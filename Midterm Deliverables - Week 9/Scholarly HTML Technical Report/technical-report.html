                <p>Striving to create a web application that meets the standards of any user, we have considered several
                    important quality attributes aimed at delivering the expected performance. We searched a solution
                    that is efficient both in terms of time, providing quick responses to various requests, and in terms
                    of costs. In the following sections we detail some important non-functional requirements of the Bogx

            <h2 id="linked-data-explanation" class ="title">6. How this solution conforms to the linked data principles</h2>
            <div>Our application uses Apache Jena framework (which provides tools for creating a Semantic Web) and aims to fulfill several aspects that conforms to the linked data principles, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>The data description is based on existing vocabularies, using FOAF, Review, the ones provided by schema.org, etc. in conjunction with other sources of interest such as DBpedia.</li>
                    <li>Utilize RDF (Resource Description Framework) to represent data in a graph format. Apache Jena provides APIs for creating, parsing, and working with RDF data. Also, SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) is used for querying and retrieving data from RDF graphs.</li>
                    <li>Each resource in the system has a unique URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that can be used to access and reference that resource.</li>
                    <li>Bogx application creates links between related resources by using RDF properties to establish relationships. Apache Jena supports linking and navigating between interconnected resources.</li>
                    <li>Use Apache Jena's serializers to output RDF data in various formats such as Turtle, N-Triples, or JSON-LD.</li>

            <h2 id="conclusion" class ="title">7. Conclusion</h2>
            <p itemprop="conclusion">The presented application named "Botanical Gardens Smart Explorer" proposes an interesting idea of displaying and interacting with the environment of the Botanical Garden in Iasi. It aims to facilitate the process of information and documentation, creating an optimal environment to delevop a passion for botanical gardens' cartography. The most important functionalities of the application include the use of an interactive map of the Botanical Garden, accessing and participating in organized events, and presenting information (filtered according to user preferences) about plants and fauna. The technologies used in the system are modern and aim towards developing a project that is portable, secure, and high-performing.</p>
            <p itemprop="improvement">Being an application about botanical gardens' cartography, it could be improved and expanded by adding new functionalities. As future directions, we have considered implementing a method to enhance the app's accessibility by providing features for users with disabilities, such as audio descriptions, text-to-speech, or larger font options. Also, we would like to introduce support for multiple languages to cater to diverse visitors and tourists who speak different languages. An interesting idea is the implementation of a system of plant identification: a functionality that employs image recognition technology  where users can take photos of plants, and the app identifies and provides details about them.</p>
