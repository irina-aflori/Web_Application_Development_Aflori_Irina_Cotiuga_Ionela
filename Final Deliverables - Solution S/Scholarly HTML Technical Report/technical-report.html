                        React is used for builduing the user interface, to efficiently manage the UI state, handle user
                        inputs and update the interface in response to changes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Java serves as the backend programming language for the application, being well-suited for
                        processing complex
                        tasks, handling data, and interfacing with external APIs, contributing to the overall
                        functionality
                        and performance of
                        the Bogx web application. We opted for Spring Boot, part of the larger Spring Framework as it
                        offers
                        a wide range of features in the development process.

                    <li>
                        RDF is employed for representing and linking data about plants, events, markers, feedback, etc.
                        in a
                        semantic and structured format. It enables the
                        creation of a knowledge graph that can be queried and analyzed for comprehensive data.

                    <li>
                        SPARQL is a query language for RDF data. By using SPARQL queries, users can interact with the
                        application to
                        obtain detailed and customized information about plants, taxonomy, and other relevant data.

                    <li>
                        Apache Jena Framework provides tools and libraries for RDF processing, storage, and querying. In
                        Bogx application,
                        Apache Jena facilitates the handling of RDF data, allowing for efficient storage, retrieval, and
                        manipulation of
                        information. We used Apache Jena Fuseki server, a popular open-source SPARQL server that
                        provides
                        capabilities for storing, querying, and managing RDF data.

                        Taxonomies are utilized for organizing and categorizing plant information in a hierarchical
                        manner.
                        This hierarchical
                        classification system helps users navigate and explore plant data more efficiently.

                    <li>
                        Schema.org markup is incorporated to enhance the search engine visibility and understanding of
                        the
                        Bogx web
                        application. It provide search engines with structured information about plants,
                        enabling richer search results and potentially improving the discoverability of the content.

                <h3 id="app-architecture">3.1 App Architecture</h3>
                <p>
                    The diagram presented below shows the architecture of the application and how it interacts with the
                    technologies and libraries used.<br>
                    The process begins with user interaction on their device through a web browser. <br>
                    The frontend application, built using React.js, handles the user interface and sends HTTP requests
                    to
                    the backend API. <br>
                    The backend application, developed in Java, serves as the core of the application. It contains
                    controllers for handling incoming
                    requests and service business logic for processing data. <br>
                    The backend app interacts with a SPARQL processor. This processor is responsible for processing
                    SPARQL
                    queries, initiating updates to the RDF store, and providing a comprehensive view of linked data.
                    <br>
                    The SPARQL processor facilitates changes to the RDF store, ensuring that the linked data
                    representation
                    is updated. <br>
                    After updates are made in the RDF store, the results are communicated back to the backend Java
                    application. <br>
                    The backend app processes the results, consolidates the data from the RDF store, and prepares a JSON
                    response. <br>
                    The JSON response is then sent back to the frontend React.js application, which interprets the data
                    and
                    updates the user interface accordingly. <br>
                    The final step involves sending the processed data back to the user's device, completing the user
                    interaction loop.

                <h3 id="storage-system">3.2 RDF-based knowledge models & the modeling of our ontology</h3>
                <p itemprop="storage">We have designed our ontology by taking into account both the needs of a user when
                    accessing the application and the importance of correct and consistent modeling, characterized by
                    effectiveness, expressiveness, and practical utility.</p>
                <p>We will detail a few important aspects regarding the designed RDF-based knowledge model:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Expressiveness of the vocabulary: we consider that we detailed the vocabulary to accurately
                        represent the domain's entities and their relationships. For example, distinguishing between
                        Plant and PlantSpecies allows for capturing both individual plant instances and their broader
                        classifications. Also, our model accommodate a wide range of plant-related data, from botanical
                        characteristics to care instructions. This flexibility supports diverse applications, from
                        educational content to garden management.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        User interaction: We considered how users will interact with the ontology. For instance, Marker
                        entities could be linked to physical locations in the Bogx app Google Maps map, enhancing user
                        navigation and engagement.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Feedback integration: Incorporating EventFeedback and PlantFeedback classes enables collecting
                        valuable insights from visitors, which can inform future improvements. This feedback loop
                        enhances the system's value to users.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Consistency: We have ensured that we have a consistent hierarchy within the ontology, such as a
                        clear parent-child relationship between PlantSpecies and individual Plant instances. This
                        structure aids in querying and data analysis.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>In the following section, we will present representative diagrams to understand the modeling of our
                    ontology:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="bold">PlantSpecies:</span> a class that contains 2 data properties: the name of the
                        plant category and a representative image. This class categorizes plants into distinct species,
                        based on shared botanical characteristics, genetic makeup, and taxonomy. It serves as a crucial
                        reference for understanding the diversity and relationships among plants. This classification
                        aids in the systematic study and preservation of plant biodiversity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="bold">Plant:</span> a class that refers to the necessary details for displaying
                        information about a plant
                        (name, description, image of the plant, its location, maintenance tips, diseases that may
                        appear). This class serves as the foundation for tracking and managing the lifecycle and
                        conditions of each plant in a garden or natural setting.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="bold">isPartOf:</span> an object property that creates a hierarchical relationship
                        between individual Plant instances and their corresponding PlantSpecies, signifying that each
                        Plant belongs to or is a member of a specific PlantSpecies. This linkage allows for the
                        organization of plants into their taxonomic categories, facilitating easier management,
                        identification, and study of botanical diversity within the system.

                <p>We opted for using the DBpedia tool as a knowledge source for our ontology, so that all plant species
                    and the plants within a species have information from DBpedia. We chose this source because it
                    managed to enrich the ontology with scientific names, classifications, descriptions, and relevant
                    images. This method saved time and resources compared to manually compiling such detailed
                    information. Among the benefits of this approach is also the fact that we wanted a platform meant to
                    offer educational, real, and important information and it managed to turn the app into a powerful
                    learning tool. Additionally, the information and links between resources provided by DBpedia helped
                    us form a taxonomy, a classification of plants into different plant species.</p>

                    <li>finding resources for each plant, creating a hierarchy so that each plant belongs to a plant
                        species, and determining the details about a plant that we want to extract: name, description,
                        image, etc;</li>

Castanea crenata exhibits resistance to Phytophthora cinnamomi, the fungal pathogen that causes ink disease in several Castanea species. The mechanism of resistance of Castanea crenata to Phytophthora cinnamomi may derive from its expression of the Cast_Gnk2-like gene.",

Root feeding is strongly recommended to help the tree combat the disease.\nDutch Elm disease is the most destructive shade tree disease. Dutch elm disease causes serious economic and aesthetic losses in cities and towns where the elms are the principal shade tree.\nPoplar Cankers is a fungus disease whose activity results in cankers or physical deformities.",

They’ll grow at odd angles, grow inward toward the tree’s center, or brush too closely against other branches.\nNever cut a branch flush to its trunk. Prune above the branch bark ridge and branch collar. Cutting a tree limb flush to the trunk compromises the tree’s ability to heal and fight off disease.\nUse the right pruning tools for the job. Use a hand pruner for branches under 1/2\".  Use loppers to cut branches up to 1”.  A pruning hand saw be used for branches over 1/2”. But never use a carpenter’s saw.",

                            This SPARQL query dynamically updates an event's participant count and adds a new
                            participant (person) to the event within an ontology. It is structured into three main
                            sections: DELETE, INSERT, and WHERE. The DELETE clause removes the current participant count
                            (?currentCount) for an event (?event) to prepare for updating this information. The INSERT
                            clause
                            inserts the updated participant count (?newCount), incremented by 1 or initialized to 1 if
                            no count was previously recorded,
                            creates a new Person instance (?newPerson) with the first name and last name provided by the
                            person object, and
                            associates the new Person instance with the event by using the onto:hasParticipant property.
                            The WHERE clause
                            identifies the specific event (?event) by its eventId,
                            optionally matches the current participant count if it exists,
                            uses the BIND function to calculate the new participant count, incrementing the existing
                            count by 1 or defaulting to 1 if no count exists, and
                            generates a new unique URI for the Person instance using the STRUUID() function to ensure a
                            unique identifier for each new participant.

                principles</h2>
            <div>Our application uses Apache Jena framework (which provides tools for creating a Semantic Web) and aims
                to fulfill several aspects that conforms to the linked data principles, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Utilizing Semantic Web technologies, including RDF, SPARQL, and OWL, to convey information.</li>
                    <li>Utilize RDF (Resource Description Framework) to represent data in a graph format. Apache Jena
                        provides APIs for creating, parsing, and working with RDF data. Also, SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol
                        and RDF Query Language) is used for querying and retrieving data from RDF graphs.
                    </li>
                    <li>Each resource in the system has a unique URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that can be used to
                        access and reference that resource.
                    </li>
                    <li>Bogx application creates links between related resources by using RDF properties to establish
                        relationships. Apache Jena supports linking and navigating between interconnected resources.
                    </li>
                    <li>Use Apache Jena's serializers to output RDF data in RDF/XML format.</li>
                </ul>
                We opted for Apache Jena Fuseki server, an open-source SPARQL server that provides capabilities for
                sophisticated querying and manipulation of RDF data. Using Apache Jena Fuseki, we created an application
                that respects the Semantic Web and Linked Data principles. Another important aspect is that we utilized
                Fuseki server as a scalable Data Store, with a persistent storage, as well as a method for querying
                backend for our Spring Boot application. We realized SPARQL querying and updates: through HTTP requests
                from Spring Boot app to Fuseki's SPARQL endpoint, we queried our RDF data and update it.
                <br />
                In the context of Bogx application, we used DBpedia as a relevant source of information: all plant
                species and all plants from every species have data description from DBPedia.

            <h2 id="proj-progress" class="title">7. Project Progress</h2>
            <p>
                The development of the project unfolded in a structured and systematic manner, incorporating a variety
                of technologies and methodologies to ensure a robust and user-friendly application. Here's an outline of
                the project development progress:
            <ul>
                <li> <span class="bold"> Initial planning and requirements set:</span> The project began with an
                    analysis of the application
                    requirements. This initial phase involved identifying the core functionalities, target user base,
                    and the overall goal of the application. Decisions on what technologies to use were made during this
                    phase, focusing on a stack that includes React for the frontend, Java Spring Boot for the backend,
                    and Apache Jena Fuseki as the RDF store for managing the ontology.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">UI/UX design with Figma:</span> Figma was chosen to design the user interface for
                    its collaborative
                    features
                    and ease of use. Mockups for the application's UI were created, offering a visual representation of
                    the user experience and ensuring that the design met the project's needs and goals.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">System architecture and diagrams:</span> To better understand and communicate the
                    structure of the
                    application, we developed some diagrams: architecture diagrams to depict how the
                    different components of the system interact, flow diagrams and use case diagrams to outline the user
                    journey through
                    the application.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Ontology modeling:</span> We opted to use Protégé for this
                    task, starting with the definition of classes, data properties, and object properties that represent
                    the domain of interest. This ontology serves as the backbone of the application, facilitating the
                    semantic organization of information.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Ontology population:</span> The ontology was populated with data from various
                    sources:
                    <ul>
                        <li>For plant and plant species information, SPARQL queries against DBpedia were used to extract
                            and import relevant data.</li>
                        <li>The list of taxes and services was inspired by the official site of the Iasi Botanical
                            Garden, ensuring local relevance and accuracy.</li>
                        <li>Event data was crafted based on user needs analysis, focusing on events that would engage
                            and interest the target audience.</li>
                        <li>Participant names for events were generated using mock data from Mockaroo, simulating
                            realistic user interaction.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><span class="bold">Development of the React application:</span> A React application was created to
                    serve as the front end. This involved developing views for each system component, ensuring a
                    responsive and intuitive user interface that interacts seamlessly with the backend.</li>
                <li> <span class="bold">Backend development with Java Spring Boot:</span> The backend application was
                    developed using Java Spring
                    Boot, known for its efficiency and ease of use in creating services. This component handles
                    business logic, data processing, and communication with the Apache Jena Fuseki server.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Integration with Apache Jena Fuseki Server:</span> Our ontology, hosted on the
                    Apache Jena Fuseki server, was used as an RDF store. This setup enables sophisticated query and
                    update capabilities for the ontology, using SPARQL for data interrogation and manipulation.
                </li>
                <li><span class="bold">Creating and implementing endpoints:</span> Endpoints were created in the backend
                    to facilitate communication between the frontend and the RDF store. This involved crafting SPARQL
                    queries to retrieve or modify data within the Fuseki server according to the application's
                    functionality needs and add some method implementation for our functionalities.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Creating a GoogleMaps JavaScript API map in our app:</span> We researched how to
                    create a map, how to set the map and desired coordinates, how to add markers, how to interact with
                    the map, and how to follow the route and directions between two points on the map.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Connecting frontend to backend:</span> The final phase involved linking the
                    frontend React application with the Java Spring Boot backend, ensuring smooth data flow and
                    functionality across the system.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Iterative documentation:</span> As the project progressed from planning through
                    development to integration, maintaining comprehensive documentation remained a continuous effort.
                    This included updating technical documents, user guides, and API documentation to reflect the
                    system's current state and capabilities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="conclusion" class="title">8. Conclusion</h2>
            <p itemprop="conclusion">The presented application named "Botanical Gardens Smart Explorer" proposes an
                interesting idea of displaying and interacting with the environment of the Botanical Garden in Iasi. It
                aims to facilitate the process of information and documentation, creating an optimal environment to
                delevop a passion for botanical gardens' cartography. The most important functionalities of the
                application include the use of an interactive map of the Botanical Garden, accessing and participating
                in organized events, and presenting information (filtered according to user preferences) about plants.
                The technologies used in the system are modern and aim towards developing a project that is portable,
                secure, and high-performing.</p>
            <p itemprop="improvement">Being an application about botanical gardens' cartography, it could be improved
                and expanded by adding new functionalities. As future directions, we have considered implementing a
                method to enhance the app's accessibility by providing features for users with disabilities, such as
                audio descriptions, text-to-speech, or larger font options. Also, we would like to introduce support for
                multiple languages to cater to diverse visitors and tourists who speak different languages. An
                interesting idea is the implementation of a system of plant identification: a functionality that employs
                image recognition technology where users can take photos of plants, and the app identifies and provides
                details about them. Also, it would be a good idea to add a chatbot that can assist
                users in querying plant information, provide tips on gardening, or answer specific questions. Another
                wonderful idea is to display diverse fauna categories within the botanical garden, offering a curated
                collection of animals and other fauna inhabiting the garden. By selecting an individual element, it will
                be nice to access detailed information about its species, behaviors, habitat, and unique
                characteristics.</p>
