                    <li>
                        React is used for builduing the user interface, to efficiently manage the UI state, handle user 
                        inputs and update the interface in response to changes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Java serves as the backend programming language for the application, being well-suited for processing complex 
                        tasks, handling data, and interfacing with external APIs, contributing to the overall functionality and performance of 
                        the Bogx web application. We opted for Spring Boot, part of the larger Spring Framework as it offers a wide range of features in the development process.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        RDF is employed for representing and linking data about plants, events, markers, feedback, etc. in a semantic and structured format. It enables the
                        creation of a knowledge graph that can be queried and analyzed for comprehensive data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        SPARQL is a query language for RDF data. By using SPARQL queries, users can interact with the application to
                        obtain detailed and customized information about plants, taxonomy, and other relevant data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Apache Jena Framework provides tools and libraries for RDF processing, storage, and querying. In Bogx application, 
                        Apache Jena facilitates the handling of RDF data, allowing for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of 
                        information. We used Apache Jena Fuseki server, a popular open-source SPARQL server that provides capabilities for storing, querying, and managing RDF data. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Taxonomies are utilized for organizing and categorizing plant information in a hierarchical manner. This hierarchical 
                        classification system helps users navigate and explore plant data more efficiently.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Schema.org markup is incorporated to enhance the search engine visibility and understanding of the Bogx web 
                        application. It provide search engines with structured information about plants, 
                        enabling richer search results and potentially improving the discoverability of the content.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Google Maps JavaScript API enhances the application by providing an interactive map where users can explore 
                        the botanical garden or specific regions with visual representations on a map.

                <h3 id="app-architecture">3.1 App Architecture</h3>
                <p>
                    The diagram presented below shows the architecture of the application and how it interacts with the technologies and libraries used.<br>
                    The process begins with user interaction on their device through a web browser. <br> 
                    The frontend application, built using React.js, handles the user interface and sends HTTP requests to the backend API. <br>
                    The backend application, developed in Java, serves as the core of the application. It contains controllers for handling incoming 
                    requests and service business logic for processing data. <br>
                    The backend app interacts with a SPARQL processor. This processor is responsible for processing SPARQL 
                    queries, initiating updates to the RDF store, and providing a comprehensive view of linked data. <br>
                    The SPARQL processor facilitates changes to the RDF store, ensuring that the linked data representation is updated. <br>
                    After updates are made in the RDF store, the results are communicated back to the backend Java application. <br>
                    The backend app processes the results, consolidates the data from the RDF store, and prepares a JSON response. <br>
                    The JSON response is then sent back to the frontend React.js application, which interprets the data and updates the user interface accordingly. <br>
                    The final step involves sending the processed data back to the user's device, completing the user interaction loop.

        <section itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Article" role="doc-app-linked-data">
            <h2 id="linked-data-explanation" class ="title">6. How this solution conforms to the linked data principles</h2>
            <div>Our application uses Apache Jena framework (which provides tools for creating a Semantic Web) and aims to fulfill several aspects that conforms to the linked data principles, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Utilizing Semantic Web technologies, including RDF, SPARQL, and OWL, to convey information.</li>
                    <li>Utilize RDF (Resource Description Framework) to represent data in a graph format. Apache Jena provides APIs for creating, parsing, and working with RDF data. Also, SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) is used for querying and retrieving data from RDF graphs.</li>
                    <li>Each resource in the system has a unique URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that can be used to access and reference that resource.</li>
                    <li>Bogx application creates links between related resources by using RDF properties to establish relationships. Apache Jena supports linking and navigating between interconnected resources.</li>
                    <li>Use Apache Jena's serializers to output RDF data in RDF/XML format.</li>
                </ul>
                We opted for Apache Jena Fuseki server, an open-source SPARQL server that provides capabilities for sophisticated querying and manipulation of RDF data. Using Apache Jena Fuseki, we created an application that respects the Semantic Web and Linked Data principles. Another important aspect is that we utilized Fuseki server as a scalable Data Store, with a persistent storage, as well as a method for querying backend for our Spring Boot application. We realized SPARQL querying and updates: through HTTP requests from Spring Boot app to Fuseki's SPARQL endpoint, we queried our RDF data and update it. 
                <br/>
                In the context of Bogx application, we used DBpedia as a relevant source of information: all plant species and all plants from every species have data description from DBPedia.

        <section itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Article" role="doc-conclusion">
            <h2 id="conclusion" class ="title">7. Conclusion</h2>
            <p itemprop="conclusion">The presented application named "Botanical Gardens Smart Explorer" proposes an interesting idea of displaying and interacting with the environment of the Botanical Garden in Iasi. It aims to facilitate the process of information and documentation, creating an optimal environment to delevop a passion for botanical gardens' cartography. The most important functionalities of the application include the use of an interactive map of the Botanical Garden, accessing and participating in organized events, and presenting information (filtered according to user preferences) about plants. The technologies used in the system are modern and aim towards developing a project that is portable, secure, and high-performing.</p>
            <p itemprop="improvement">Being an application about botanical gardens' cartography, it could be improved and expanded by adding new functionalities. As future directions, we have considered implementing a method to enhance the app's accessibility by providing features for users with disabilities, such as audio descriptions, text-to-speech, or larger font options. Also, we would like to introduce support for multiple languages to cater to diverse visitors and tourists who speak different languages. An interesting idea is the implementation of a system of plant identification: a functionality that employs image recognition technology  where users can take photos of plants, and the app identifies and provides details about them. Also, it would be a good idea to add a chatbot that can assist 
                users in querying plant information, provide tips on gardening, or answer specific questions. Another wonderful idea is to display diverse fauna categories within the botanical garden, offering a curated collection of animals and other fauna inhabiting the garden. By selecting an individual element, it will be nice to access detailed information about its species, behaviors, habitat, and unique characteristics.</p>
