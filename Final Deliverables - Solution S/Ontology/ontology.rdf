        <j.0:plantMaintenance>Apply a layer of organic mulch around the base of ornamental plants to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature. Fertilize ornamental plants with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season. Provide winter protection for ornamental plants that are not cold-hardy in your region. Water ornamental plants based on their specific requirements. Use a watering schedule that allows the soil to dry out slightly between waterings to prevent overwatering and root rot.Understand the sunlight needs of each ornamental plant. Some prefer full sun, while others thrive in partial or full shade. Incorporate organic matter, such as compost, into the soil for improved fertility.</j.0:plantMaintenance>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Achillea millefolium, commonly known as yarrow (/ˈjæroʊ/) or common yarrow, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. Other common names include old man&apos;s pepper, devil&apos;s nettle, sanguinary, milfoil, soldier&apos;s woundwort, and thousand seal. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Asia, Europe, and North America. It has been introduced as a feed for livestock in New Zealand and Australia.</j.0:plantDescription>
        <j.0:plantDiseases>Volutella leaf and stem blight is the most common disease on pachysandra. The disease is usually promoted by excessive moisture for long periods of time. The fungus causes black blotches on the leaves and black cankers on the stem. To control Volutella leaf blight, avoid excess moisture from overhead irrigation. A fungicide spray program started in the spring can usually prevent the disease from spreading.
Several fungal leaf spots and a severe Xanthomonas bacterial leaf spot are possible causes for brown or black spots on English ivy.</j.0:plantDiseases>

        <j.0:plantMaintenance>In the year after planting, check the soil regularly and water it deeply when it begins to dry out. Watering frequency will depend on the site, soil composition, temperature, exposure to wind and amount of rainfall.For plants that require rich soil, work in a 2.5 cm layer of compost around the base of the plants every year.Remove weeds as they appear to prevent them from spreading. Some ground covers become less vigorous after a number of years. To revitalize them, divide clumps in spring or fall.</j.0:plantMaintenance>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Aegopodium podagraria, commonly called ground elder, is a species of flowering plant in the carrot family Apiaceae that grows in shady places. The name &quot;ground elder&quot; comes from the superficial similarity of its leaves and flowers to those of elder (Sambucus), which is not closely related. Other common names include herb gerard, bishop&apos;s weed, goutweed, gout wort, snow-in-the-mountain, English masterwort and wild masterwort. It is the type species of the genus Aegopodium. It is native to Europe and Asia, but has been introduced around the world as an ornamental plant, where it occasionally poses an ecological threat as an invasive exotic plant.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Alkanna tinctoria, the dyer&apos;s alkanet or simply alkanet, is a herbaceous flowering plant in the borage family Boraginaceae. Its roots are used to produce a red dye. The plant is also known as dyers&apos; bugloss, orchanet, Spanish bugloss, or Languedoc bugloss. It is native to the Mediterranean region. A. tinctoria has 30 chromosomes and is regarded as a dysploid at the tetraploid level (4x + 2). A. tinctoria has a bright blue flower. The plant has a root of blackish appearance externally, but blue-red inside, with a whitish core. The root produces a fine red colouring material, which has been used as a dye in the Mediterranean region since antiquity. The dyestuff in its roots is soluble in alcohol, ether, and the oils, but is insoluble in water. It is used to give colour to wines and alcoholic tinctures, to vegetable oils, and to varnishes. Powdered and mixed with oil, the alkanet root is used as a wood stain. When mixed into an oily environment, it imparts a crimson color to the oil, which when applied to a wood, moves the wood color towards dark-red-brown rosewood, and accentuates the grain of the wood. Alkanet is traditionally used in Indian food under the name ratan jot, and lends its red colour to some versions of the curry dish rogan josh. In Australia, alkanet is approved for use as a food colouring, but in the European Union, it is not. It has been used as colorant for lipstick and rouge. In alkaline environments, alkanet dye has a blue color, with the color changing to crimson on addition of an acid. The colour is red at pH 6.1, purple at 8.8 and blue at pH 10. The colouring agent in A. tinctoria root has been chemically isolated and named alkannin. In folk medicine, it is also used to treat abscesses and inflammations. In English in the late medieval era, the name alkanet meant A. tinctoria. In the centuries since then, the name has come to be used informally for some botanically related other plants; see Alkanet.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Alliaria petiolata, or garlic mustard, is a biennial flowering plant in the mustard family (Brassicaceae). It is native to Europe, western and central Asia, north-western Africa, Morocco, Iberia and the British Isles, north to northern Scandinavia, and east to northern Pakistan and Xinjiang in western China. In the first year of growth, plants form clumps of round, slightly wrinkled leaves, that when crushed smell like garlic. The plants flower in spring of the next year, producing cross shaped white flowers in dense clusters. As the flowering stems bloom they elongate into a spike-like shape. When flowering is complete, plants produce upright fruits that release seeds in mid-summer. Plants are often found growing along the margins of hedges, giving rise to the old British folk name of jack-by-the-hedge. Other common names include: garlic mustard, garlic root, hedge garlic, sauce-alone, jack-in-the-bush, penny hedge and poor man&apos;s mustard. The genus name Alliaria, &quot;resembling Allium&quot;, refers to the garlic-like odour of the crushed foliage.

        <j.0:plantDescription>Anthriscus sylvestris, known as cow parsley, wild chervil, wild beaked parsley, Queen Anne&apos;s lace or keck, is a herbaceous biennial or short-lived perennial plant in the family Apiaceae (Umbelliferae), genus Anthriscus. It is also sometimes called mother-die (especially in the UK), a name that is also applied to the common hawthorn. It is native to Europe, western Asia and northwestern Africa. It is related to other diverse members of Apiaceae, such as parsley, carrot, hemlock and hogweed. It is often confused with Daucus carota, another member of the Apiaceae also known as &quot;Queen Anne&apos;s lace&quot; or &quot;wild carrot&quot;.</j.0:plantDescription>
        <j.0:plantDiseases>Powdery Mildew: White, powdery spots on leaves.Affected Herbs: Mint, basil, oregano.Prevention/Treatment: Provide good air circulation, avoid overhead watering, and use fungicidal sprays.
Downy Mildew: Yellow or brown spots on the upper side of leaves, a downy-like growth on the underside. Affected Herbs: Basil, rosemary, sage. Prevention/Treatment: Improve air circulation, avoid overhead watering, and use copper-based fungicides.
Root Rot: Wilting, yellowing, and eventual collapse of the plant. Affected Herbs: Basil, cilantro, parsley. Prevention/Treatment: Ensure well-draining soil, avoid overwatering, and use sterilized soil for container plants.
Bacterial Leaf Spot: Dark spots with yellow halos on leaves. Affected Herbs: Basil, parsley, cilantro. Prevention/Treatment: Water at the base, avoid overhead watering, and use copper-based sprays.</j.0:plantDiseases>

        <j.0:plantMaintenance>Most herbs prefer full sunlight. Ensure your herbs receive at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day. Place potted herbs near south or west-facing windows indoors.
Use well-draining, nutrient-rich soil with good aeration. Amend the soil with organic matter like compost for improved fertility.
Water herbs consistently, keeping the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Allow the soil to dry out slightly between waterings to prevent root rot.
If growing herbs in containers, choose appropriately sized pots with drainage holes to prevent waterlogging.</j.0:plantMaintenance>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Arrojadoa is a genus of cacti, comprising 6 species and several varieties. It is named after the Brazilian botanist (1872–1932) who was superintendent of the Brazilian Railways at the time that Britton and Rose described the genus in 1920. The genus occurs only in northern Brazil and is found at rocky places, under shrubs, which support their frail stalk. They are subtropical plants, with very little frost tolerance.</j.0:plantDescription>
        <j.0:plantDiseases>Although most problems associated with cacti and succulents grown as houseplants are bacterial or fungal diseases caused by overwatering, they do get the occasional insect pest like mealy bugs, and root mealybugs.
Cochinealis usually found on cactus of the Opuntia genera like  Angel Wing or  Rufida Minima Cinnamon cactus and can be treated using only a spray of water.
Corking is an entirely natural occurrence with cactus and will not cause any harm. This is simply an indication that your plant has lived and grown large enough to require a little extra care.</j.0:plantDiseases>

        <j.0:plantMaintenance>Just like with succulents, cacti need regular watering to help them grow during their active season. As a general rule of thumb, it is best to provide cacti with at least 4 to 6 hours of bright sunlight per day to encourage flowering. Your cactus&apos; soil must be well-draining. Cactus should be repotted at least once a year to give them fresh soil and to check their roots to ensure that they’re healthy. To encourage new growth and flowering, regularly feed your cactus with a low-nitrogen or cactus blend fertilizer every few weeks throughout Spring and Summer, when it is actively growing.</j.0:plantMaintenance>

Never cut a branch flush to its trunk. Prune above the branch bark ridge and branch collar. Cutting a tree limb flush to the trunk compromises the tree’s ability to heal and fight off disease.
Use the right pruning tools for the job. Use a hand pruner for branches under 1/2&quot;.  Use loppers to cut branches up to 1”.  A pruning hand saw be used for branches over 1/2”. But never use a carpenter’s saw.</j.0:plantMaintenance>

Ritter, in Rayones, Nuevo León, Mexico, this genus was thought to be monotypic (with Aztekium ritteri) until a second species (Aztekium hintonii) was discovered by , in Galeana, Nuevo León in 1991. A further possible species, Aztekium valdezii, was described in 2011, but is considered to be a synonym of A. ritteri.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>&quot;Binsey Poplars&quot; is a poem by Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844–1889), written in 1879. The poem was inspired by the felling of a row of poplar trees near the village of Binsey, northwest of Oxford, England, and overlooking Port Meadow on the bank of the River Thames. The replacements for these trees, running from Binsey north to Godstow, lasted until 2004, when replanting began again. The Bodleian Library of Oxford University holds a draft manuscript of the poem, handwritten by Hopkins, acquired in 2013.</j.0:plantDescription>

Never cut a branch flush to its trunk. Prune above the branch bark ridge and branch collar. Cutting a tree limb flush to the trunk compromises the tree’s ability to heal and fight off disease.
Use the right pruning tools for the job. Use a hand pruner for branches under 1/2&quot;.  Use loppers to cut branches up to 1”.  A pruning hand saw be used for branches over 1/2”. But never use a carpenter’s saw.</j.0:plantMaintenance>

The taxonomy of blackberries has historically been confused because of hybridization and apomixis, so that species have often been grouped together and called species aggregates. For example, the entire subgenus Rubus has been called the Rubus fruticosus aggregate, although the species R. fruticosus is considered a synonym of R. plicatus. Rubus armeniacus (&quot;Himalayan&quot; blackberry) is considered a noxious weed and invasive species in many regions of the Pacific Northwest of Canada and the United States, where it grows out of control in urban and suburban parks and woodlands.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Blossfeldia is a genus of cactus (family Cactaceae) containing only one species, Blossfeldia liliputiana, native to South America in northwestern Argentina (Jujuy, Salta, Tucumán, Catamarca and Mendoza Provinces) and southern Bolivia (Santa Cruz and Potosí Departments). It grows at 1,200–3,500 m altitude in the Andes, typically growing in rock crevices, and often close to waterfalls. It is of note as the smallest cactus species in the world, with a mature size of around 10–12 mm diameter. The flowers are white or rarely pink, 6–15 mm long and 5–7 mm diameter. The genus Blossfeldia has been divided into many separate species; however most morphological evidence supports that the genus is monotypic, and contains only Blossfeldia liliputiana. The species is named after the fictional country of Lilliput, where all of the inhabitants are minute.</j.0:plantDescription>
        <j.0:plantDiseases>Although most problems associated with cacti and succulents grown as houseplants are bacterial or fungal diseases caused by overwatering, they do get the occasional insect pest like mealy bugs, and root mealybugs.

        <j.0:plantDescription>Cactinae is a subtribe of cacti in the tribe Cacteae. It is notable to cactus-lovers, as it contains the large genus Mammillaria. They all produce globular (turning cylindrical) stems and most produce offshoots freely, although this may take some species up to 30 years. The tubercles are generally arranged in spirals. The principal genera of this subtribe are Coryphantha and Mammillaria.</j.0:plantDescription>
        <j.0:plantDiseases>Although most problems associated with cacti and succulents grown as houseplants are bacterial or fungal diseases caused by overwatering, they do get the occasional insect pest like mealy bugs, and root mealybugs.
Cochinealis usually found on cactus of the Opuntia genera like  Angel Wing or  Rufida Minima Cinnamon cactus and can be treated using only a spray of water.
Corking is an entirely natural occurrence with cactus and will not cause any harm. This is simply an indication that your plant has lived and grown large enough to require a little extra care.</j.0:plantDiseases>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Calendula maritima, known as the sea marigold and trailing calendula, is a very rare species from the family of Asteraceae. Some scientists regarded it as Calendula suffruticosa subspecies maritima. This halophytic plant is endemic to the western part of Sicily in small coastal habitats, and is a critically endangered species. As of 2012, this plant could still be found in only five small sites in East Sicily. The Province of Trapani has chosen the plant as its official symbol. The sea marigold occurs only on the Sicilian coast: on the island mainland between Marsala and the Monte Cofano; and on the two nearby islets Isola Grande dello Stagnone and Isola la Formica. The most significant population is in a small 10-km2 (3.9-mi2) nature reserve area within the Riserva Naturale Saline di Trapani e Paceco. It is on the IUCN Red List of critically endangered plant species.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Calluna vulgaris, common heather, ling, or simply heather, is the sole species in the genus Calluna in the flowering plant family Ericaceae. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub growing to 20 to 50 centimetres (8 to 20 in) tall, or rarely to 1 metre (40 in) and taller, and is found widely in Europe and Asia Minor on acidic soils in open sunny situations and in moderate shade. It is the dominant plant in most heathland and moorland in Europe, and in some bog vegetation and acidic pine and oak woodland. It is tolerant of grazing and regenerates following occasional burning, and is often managed in nature reserves and grouse moors by sheep or cattle grazing, and also by light burning. Calluna was separated from the closely related genus Erica by Richard Anthony Salisbury, who devised the generic name Calluna probably from the Ancient Greek Kallyno (καλλύνω), &quot;beautify, sweep clean&quot;, in reference to its traditional use in besoms. The specific epithet vulgaris is Latin for &apos;common&apos;. Calluna is differentiated from Erica by its corolla and calyx each being in four parts instead of five.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Calymmanthium is a monotypic genus of primitive tree-like cacti from northern Peru. The only species is Calymmanthium substerile (also known as C. fertile). It belongs to the tribe Lymanbensonieae. Calymmanthium is absolutely unique among flowering plants in the mode of its floral development. The young flower is completely encased within the plant&apos;s stem until it is fully developed, at which time a crack develops in the stem, allowing pollinators access. Diploperianthium F.Ritter (nom. inval.) has been brought into synonymy with this genus.</j.0:plantDescription>

As a general rule of thumb, it is best to provide cacti with at least 4 to 6 hours of bright sunlight per day to encourage flowering. Your cactus&apos; soil must be well-draining. Cactus should be repotted at least once a year to give them fresh soil and to check their roots to ensure that they’re healthy. To encourage new growth and flowering, regularly feed your cactus with a low-nitrogen or cactus blend fertilizer every few weeks throughout Spring and Summer, when it is actively growing.</j.0:plantMaintenance>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Clover or trefoil are common names for plants of the genus Trifolium (from Latin tres &apos;three&apos; + folium &apos;leaf&apos;), consisting of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume or pea family Fabaceae originating in Europe. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution with highest diversity in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics. They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants, typically growing up to 30 cm tall. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely quatrefoiled; see four-leaf clover), monofoil, bifoil, cinquefoil, hexafoil, septfoil, etcetera, with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx. Other closely related genera often called clovers include Melilotus (sweet clover) and Medicago (alfalfa or Calvary clover).</j.0:plantDescription>
        <j.0:plantDiseases>Volutella leaf and stem blight is the most common disease on pachysandra. The disease is usually promoted by excessive moisture for long periods of time. The fungus causes black blotches on the leaves and black cankers on the stem. To control Volutella leaf blight, avoid excess moisture from overhead irrigation. A fungicide spray program started in the spring can usually prevent the disease from spreading.
Several fungal leaf spots and a severe Xanthomonas bacterial leaf spot are possible causes for brown or black spots on English ivy.</j.0:plantDiseases>

Watering frequency will depend on the site, soil composition, temperature, exposure to wind and amount of rainfall.For plants that require rich soil, work in a 2.5 cm layer of compost around the base of the plants every year.Remove weeds as they appear to prevent them from spreading. Some ground covers become less vigorous after a number of years. To revitalize them, divide clumps in spring or fall.</j.0:plantMaintenance>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Coleus argentatus, synonym Plectranthus argentatus, common name silver spurflower, is a species of flowering plant in the mint family. It is native to rock outcrops and rainforest in the border region of Queensland and New South Wales, Australia. Growing to 1 m (3 ft) tall and broad, it is a spreading deciduous shrub. The hairy leaves are ovate to broad-ovate, 5–11.5 cm long, 3–5.5 cm wide with crenate margins. The hairs give the plant an overall sage green to silvery colour. The flowers are borne on terminal racemes up to 30 cm (12 in) long, and are bluish white. Originally described by Queensland botanist Stanley Thatcher Blake, its specific epithet argentatus is Latin for &quot;silver&quot;, referring to its foliage.</j.0:plantDescription>
        <j.0:plantDiseases>Volutella leaf and stem blight is the most common disease on pachysandra. The disease is usually promoted by excessive moisture for long periods of time. The fungus causes black blotches on the leaves and black cankers on the stem. To control Volutella leaf blight, avoid excess moisture from overhead irrigation. A fungicide spray program started in the spring can usually prevent the disease from spreading.
Several fungal leaf spots and a severe Xanthomonas bacterial leaf spot are possible causes for brown or black spots on English ivy.</j.0:plantDiseases>

        <j.0:plantMaintenance>In the year after planting, check the soil regularly and water it deeply when it begins to dry out. Watering frequency will depend on the site, soil composition, temperature, exposure to wind and amount of rainfall.For plants that require rich soil, work in a 2.5 cm layer of compost around the base of the plants every year.Remove weeds as they appear to prevent them from spreading. Some ground covers become less vigorous after a number of years. To revitalize them, divide clumps in spring or fall.</j.0:plantMaintenance>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Copiapoa cinerea is a species of plant in the genus Copiapoa in the family Cactaceae. The epithet cinerea comes from the Latin word for ash, by reference to the colour of the epidermis. It comes from the region of Antofagasta and the coastal zones of northern Chile. The area is very arid. However, there are dense fogs, due to cold streams of the Pacific Ocean. These fogs are frequent, in early morning or late afternoon at an altitude between 500 and 850 m (1,640 and 2,790 ft). The ash-grey to white coloured epidermis contrasts with typically black spines and woolly crown when adult.</j.0:plantDescription>

It is named after Thomas Coulter, an Irish botanist and physician. The Coulter pine produces the heaviest cone of any pine tree, up to 5 kg (11 lb). Although it has a limited range in the wild, the Coulter pine is a popular ornamental tree and is grown in many countries including the Netherlands.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Dark opal basil is a cultivar of Ocimum basilicum (sweet basil), developed by John Scarchuk and Joseph Lent at the University of Connecticut in the 1950s. With deep purple, sometimes mottled leaves, it is grown as much for its decorative appeal as for its culinary value. Dark opal basil was a 1962 winner of the All-American Selection award. Like other purple basils, the purple color is from anthocyanins, especially cyanidin-3-(di-p-coumarylglucoside)-5-glucoside but also other cyanidin based and peonidin based compounds. &apos;Dark opal&apos;, along with other large leaved purple cultivars such as &apos;Purple Ruffles&apos;, has a high concentration of anthocyanins and is considered a potential source of red pigments for the food industry. The anthocyanin concentration is about 18 mg per 100 g fresh leaves, similar to Perilla frutescens, and greater than smaller leaved purple basils such as &apos;Purple bush&apos; (at about 6 mg per 100 g).</j.0:plantDescription>

Classified within the tribe Senecioneae, it contains only one species, Delairea odorata, which was previously included in the genus Senecio as Senecio mikanioides. It is known as Cape ivy in some parts of the world (US) and German ivy in others (Britain, Ireland). Other names include parlor ivy and Italian ivy. Its multi-lobed leaves somewhat resemble those of the unrelated English ivy. Originally used as an ornamental plant on trellises and as groundcover, it is now rarely cultivated because of its invasiveness, in addition to being a weed.</j.0:plantDescription>
        <j.0:plantDiseases>Volutella leaf and stem blight is the most common disease on pachysandra. The disease is usually promoted by excessive moisture for long periods of time. The fungus causes black blotches on the leaves and black cankers on the stem. To control Volutella leaf blight, avoid excess moisture from overhead irrigation. A fungicide spray program started in the spring can usually prevent the disease from spreading.
Several fungal leaf spots and a severe Xanthomonas bacterial leaf spot are possible causes for brown or black spots on English ivy.</j.0:plantDiseases>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Dichondra is a small genus of flowering plants in the morning glory family, Convolvulaceae. They are prostrate, perennial, herbaceous plants, with creeping stems which take root readily at the leaf nodes. The flowers are white, greenish or yellowish, 2–3 mm diameter. Members of the genus are commonly known as ponysfoots and are native to tropical and cool temperate regions around the world.</j.0:plantDescription>
        <j.0:plantDiseases>Volutella leaf and stem blight is the most common disease on pachysandra. The disease is usually promoted by excessive moisture for long periods of time. The fungus causes black blotches on the leaves and black cankers on the stem. To control Volutella leaf blight, avoid excess moisture from overhead irrigation. A fungicide spray program started in the spring can usually prevent the disease from spreading.
Several fungal leaf spots and a severe Xanthomonas bacterial leaf spot are possible causes for brown or black spots on English ivy.</j.0:plantDiseases>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Epithelantha bokei is a species of cactus known by the common names pingpong ball cactus and button-cactus. It is native to Texas in the United States and Coahuila in Mexico. This cactus is disc-shaped or cylindrical and usually unbranched. It has a flat top. It usually measures 2 to 5 centimeters in width. It is so thickly covered in pale-colored spines that it is white or yellowish in color. There are up to 90 on each areole. The longest are about 7 millimeters in length. The delicate pale pink flowers are up to 1.7 centimeters long and wide. The red fruit is about a centimeter long. Much of the plant is located below ground, with a few centimeters above. It contracts into the ground during dry periods. This cactus grows on rocky or gravelly limestone substrates. Threats to the species include poaching and habitat degradation. It is in cultivation at the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix, Arizona. The specific epithet honors Norman H. Boke, plant anatomist and student of the Cactaceae.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Epithelantha micromeris is a button cactus in the genus Epithelantha, found in Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and northeast Mexico. It is characterized by its white-grey spines growing on a globular shaped stem. The density of its white spines give it the illusion of being completely grey, making it very difficult to see the green color beneath. It grows to be 1–5 cm tall, and roughly 2–4 cm in diameter. E. micromeris produces small, pink-white flowers, often considered to be some of the smallest of the cacti. These flowers give way to a bright red, cylindrical fruit which contains several black seeds and also is edible.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Euphorbia amygdaloides, the wood spurge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae, native to woodland locations in Europe, Turkey and the Caucasus. It is a bushy evergreen perennial, growing to a height of 80 cm (31 in), with dark green slightly hairy leaves about 6 cm (2 in) long. The complex green-yellow inflorescence (cyathium), typical of Euphorbia, appears in late spring and early summer. It is among the few plants that thrive in the dry shade of trees, where it is used as groundcover. It spreads rapidly by underground rhizomes and can become invasive, though relatively easy to remove. One form known is Euphorbia ‘Efanthia’. The subspecies E. amygdaloides subsp. robbiae (Turrill) Stace, known as Mrs Robb&apos;s bonnet, is grown as a garden plant, and has gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit. The milky latex of the plant is toxic and can cause irritation on contact with the skin.</j.0:plantDescription>
        <j.0:plantDiseases>Volutella leaf and stem blight is the most common disease on pachysandra. The disease is usually promoted by excessive moisture for long periods of time. The fungus causes black blotches on the leaves and black cankers on the stem. To control Volutella leaf blight, avoid excess moisture from overhead irrigation. A fungicide spray program started in the spring can usually prevent the disease from spreading.
Several fungal leaf spots and a severe Xanthomonas bacterial leaf spot are possible causes for brown or black spots on English ivy.</j.0:plantDiseases>

        <j.0:plantMaintenance>In the year after planting, check the soil regularly and water it deeply when it begins to dry out. Watering frequency will depend on the site, soil composition, temperature, exposure to wind and amount of rainfall.For plants that require rich soil, work in a 2.5 cm layer of compost around the base of the plants every year.Remove weeds as they appear to prevent them from spreading. Some ground covers become less vigorous after a number of years. To revitalize them, divide clumps in spring or fall.</j.0:plantMaintenance>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Festuca rubra is a species of grass known by the common name red fescue or creeping red fescue. It is widespread across much of the Northern Hemisphere and can tolerate many habitats and climates. It is best adapted to well-drained soils in cool, temperate climates; it prefers shadier areas and is often planted for its shade tolerance. Wild animals browse it, but it has not been important for domestic forage due to low productivity and palatability. It is also an ornamental plant for gardens.</j.0:plantDescription>
        <j.0:plantDiseases>Volutella leaf and stem blight is the most common disease on pachysandra. The disease is usually promoted by excessive moisture for long periods of time. The fungus causes black blotches on the leaves and black cankers on the stem. To control Volutella leaf blight, avoid excess moisture from overhead irrigation. A fungicide spray program started in the spring can usually prevent the disease from spreading.
Several fungal leaf spots and a severe Xanthomonas bacterial leaf spot are possible causes for brown or black spots on English ivy.</j.0:plantDiseases>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Garden roses are predominantly hybrid roses that are grown as ornamental plants in private or public gardens. They are one of the most popular and widely cultivated groups of flowering plants, especially in temperate climates. An enormous number of garden cultivars have been produced, especially over the last two centuries, though roses have been known in the garden for millennia beforehand. While most garden roses are grown for their flowers, often in dedicated rose gardens, some are also valued for other reasons, such as having ornamental fruit, providing ground cover, or for hedging. The cultivars are classified in a number of different and overlapping ways, generally without much reference to strict botanical principles. Taking overall size and shape, the most common type is the bush rose, a rounded plant from 2 foot up to about 7 foot tall, above which height roses generally fall into the &quot;&apos;climbing and rambling&apos;&quot; class, the latter spreading wider; support is needed for these. There are also miniature roses, generally small bushes, and low sprawling ground cover roses, both up to about 15 inches tall. Most modern roses are propagated by budding onto rootstocks much closer to wild species; in &quot;standard&quot; shapes there is a single bare stem, with the graft at the top of that. Shrub roses are a rather loose category that include some of the original species and cultivars closely related to them, plus cultivars that grow rather larger than most bush roses. Technically all roses are shrubs. In terms of ancestry, roses are often divided into three main groups: Wild, Old Garden, and Modern Garden roses, with many subdivisions of these. Gardeners most value roses for their large and brightly coloured flowers, which exist in every colour in the white to yellow to red part of the colour spectrum. A truly blue rose has yet to be bred, but there are a number of shades of purple. There are single or double-flowered varieties, with the latter much more popular. The petals are typically of a single colour, although bi-colour, striped and blended varieties exist. The classic hybrid tea rose flower shape, pointing up, tightly curled in the centre, with the outer petals spreading wide, is the most popular for gardens, and even more dominant in florists. But there are many alternatives. Most of the wild parent species are single-flowered with flat blooms, flowering only once, and many are still grown in gardens. Most varieties produce a single flower on a stem, but floribunda roses, introduced in the early 20th century, have a spray of several flowers, and are highly popular; they also have more continuous flowering. Most garden varieties still have thorns, though fewer than those in wild species, but some are thornless. It is often complained that modern varieties are deficient in scent from the flowers, and many are. An important development in recent decades has been extending the flowering season, in some cases to eight months in the right conditions, though the flower display still tends to be best in one or two &quot;flushes&quot;, the first in late spring. Roses are relatively easy to grow compared to many large-flowered garden plants, with the main effort, apart from basic watering and feeding, going into the pruning that most varieties need, and the training that many do. At least bush varieties are usually deadheaded, although some varieties are left for their decorative (and medicinal) rosehips. Roses are successfully grown in four continents, although a tropical climate is not ideal.</j.0:plantDescription>
        <j.0:plantDiseases>Black Spot (Diplocarpon rosae): Circular black spots with fringed edges on leaves, yellowing of affected leaves, and premature leaf drop. Prevention/Treatment: Plant disease-resistant rose varieties, provide good air circulation, and use fungicides.
Powdery Mildew (Podosphaera spp.): White, powdery substance on leaves and stems, leading to distorted growth. Prevention/Treatment: Plant in sunny locations with good air circulation, avoid overcrowding, and use fungicides.
Rust (Phragmidium spp.): Orange to rust-colored pustules on the undersides of leaves, causing yellow spots on the upper side. Prevention/Treatment: Remove affected leaves, provide good air circulation, and use fungicides.
Botrytis Blight (Botrytis cinerea): Grayish-brown fuzzy mold on petals and flower buds, often affecting plants in humid conditions. Prevention/Treatment: Provide good air circulation, avoid overhead watering, and remove affected plant parts.
Canker (Leptosphaeria coniothyrium): Sunken, discolored lesions on stems, leading to dieback. Prevention/Treatment: Prune infected branches, sanitize pruning tools, and apply fungicides.</j.0:plantDiseases>

Planting: Plant roses in the spring or fall when the soil is workable. Dig a hole large enough to accommodate the roots without crowding, and amend the soil with organic matter.
Watering: Water deeply and regularly, especially during dry periods.
Pruning: Prune roses in late winter or early spring before new growth begins. Remove dead or diseased wood, and shape the plant to encourage good air circulation.
Deadheading: Regularly remove spent flowers to encourage continuous blooming and prevent the development of hips (seed pods).</j.0:plantMaintenance>

It is one of the most popular basils for culinary use, particularly for its use in pesto, the traditional Genoese sauce. The name &quot;Basilico Genovese&quot; is protected by the European Union with the Denominazione di Origine Protetta certification. Genoese basil is produced in the provinces of Genoa, Savona and Imperia. The best genoese basil is said to be grown in Prà, a western delegation of the city of Genoa. The nearby presence of a large steel mill from the 1950s to the 1980s threatened the cultivar, said to be necessary to produce the &quot;real&quot; genoese pesto. Now the threat is mostly gone with the dismissal of the mill and the conversion of the remaining lines to less polluting productions.</j.0:plantDescription>

As a general rule of thumb, it is best to provide cacti with at least 4 to 6 hours of bright sunlight per day to encourage flowering. Your cactus&apos; soil must be well-draining. Cactus should be repotted at least once a year to give them fresh soil and to check their roots to ensure that they’re healthy. To encourage new growth and flowering, regularly feed your cactus with a low-nitrogen or cactus blend fertilizer every few weeks throughout Spring and Summer, when it is actively growing.</j.0:plantMaintenance>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Geranium macrorrhizum is a species of hardy flowering herbaceous perennial plant in the genus Geranium, family Geraniaceae. It is native to the South east Alps and the Balkans. Its common names include bigroot geranium, Bulgarian geranium, and rock crane&apos;s-bill. It has five-lobed (palmate) leaves that are aromatic when crushed, with pale pink flowers in summer. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions, where it is used as a flowering groundcover, with named cultivars selected for flower colors from white through pink to magenta. The cultivars &apos;Ingwersen&apos;s Variety&apos; (pale pink) and &apos;White-ness&apos; have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&apos;s Award of Garden Merit. The plant has been used in traditional herbal medicine. The name for all types of geraniums in general in the Bulgarian language is derived from the word здрав, which can translate as &apos;healthy&apos;, among a few related concepts. An essential oil from it is also used in aromatherapy. In addition to oils, it contains flavonoids, sesquiterpenes, phenolic acids, pigments, vitamins, and mineral salts. One of the many components of the essential oil is the sesquiterpene ketone germacrone, which has been shown to have a high and selective antimicrobial activity against the species Bacillus subtilis.

Court lindens usually were situated outside settlements in open fields &quot;under the free heaven&quot;. When located in the center of its village, the tree was also at the center of festivities, in this respect known as Tanzlinde &quot;dance linden&quot;.

Ginseng is most commonly used in the cuisines and medicines of China and Korea. Although ginseng has been used in traditional medicine over centuries, modern clinical research is inconclusive about its medical effectiveness. There is no substantial evidence that ginseng is effective for treating any medical condition, and in the United States, for example, its use has not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a prescription drug. Although ginseng is commonly sold as a dietary supplement, inconsistent manufacturing practices for supplements have led to analyses showing that ginseng products may be contaminated with toxic metals or unrelated filler compounds, and its excessive use may have adverse effects or untoward interactions with prescription drugs.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Groundcover or ground cover is any plant that grows over an area of ground. Groundcover provides protection of the topsoil from erosion and drought. In an ecosystem, the ground cover forms the layer of vegetation below the shrub layer known as the herbaceous layer. The most widespread ground covers are grasses of various types. In ecology, groundcover is a difficult subject to address because it is known by several different names and is classified in several different ways. The term groundcover could also be referring to “the herbaceous layer,” “regenerative layer&quot;, “ground flora” or even &quot;step over.&quot; In agriculture, ground cover refers to anything that lies on top of the soil and protects it from erosion and inhibits weeds. It can be anything from a low layer of grasses to a plastic material. The term ground cover can also specifically refer to landscaping fabric which is like a breathable tarp that allows water and gas exchange. In gardening jargon, however, the term groundcover refers to plants that are used in place of weeds and improves appearance by concealing bare earth.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Hacquetia epipactis (syn. Dondia epipactis (Scop.) Spreng. or Sanicula epipactis Scop.) is a species of flowering plant of the family Apiaceae, native to moist, shady woodland habitats in Europe. The only species of its genus, it is a rhizomatous, clump-forming herbaceous perennial, growing to about 30 cm in height, with glossy green leaves which only fully develop after flowering. The flowers, appearing late winter and early spring, consist of multiple tiny yellow florets framed by lime green bracts, and carried in dense spherical umbels 4 cm in diameter. It is easy to cultivate in Plant Hardiness Zones 5 to 7 according to the United States Department of Agriculture (though it is hardier than indicated and can be grown easily down to at least Zone 3), and looks best in a woodland setting which imitates its native habitat. Under the synonym Sanicula epipactis this plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&apos;s Award of Garden Merit. Known cultivars include the variegated ‘Thor’. The specific name epipactis comes from a Greek word for plants thought to curdle milk.</j.0:plantDescription>
        <j.0:plantDiseases>Volutella leaf and stem blight is the most common disease on pachysandra. The disease is usually promoted by excessive moisture for long periods of time. The fungus causes black blotches on the leaves and black cankers on the stem. To control Volutella leaf blight, avoid excess moisture from overhead irrigation. A fungicide spray program started in the spring can usually prevent the disease from spreading.
Several fungal leaf spots and a severe Xanthomonas bacterial leaf spot are possible causes for brown or black spots on English ivy.</j.0:plantDiseases>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Hatiora is a small genus of epiphytic cacti which belongs to the tribe Rhipsalideae within the subfamily Cactoideae of the Cactaceae. Recent taxonomic studies have led to the three species formerly placed in subgenus Rhipsalidopsis being removed from the genus, including the well known and widely cultivated ornamental plants known as Easter cactus or Whitsun cactus (cultivars or hybrids of the former Hatiora gaertneri).</j.0:plantDescription>
        <j.0:plantDiseases>Although most problems associated with cacti and succulents grown as houseplants are bacterial or fungal diseases caused by overwatering, they do get the occasional insect pest like mealy bugs, and root mealybugs.
Cochinealis usually found on cactus of the Opuntia genera like  Angel Wing or  Rufida Minima Cinnamon cactus and can be treated using only a spray of water.
Corking is an entirely natural occurrence with cactus and will not cause any harm. This is simply an indication that your plant has lived and grown large enough to require a little extra care.</j.0:plantDiseases>

        <j.0:plantMaintenance>Just like with succulents, cacti need regular watering to help them grow during their active season. As a general rule of thumb, it is best to provide cacti with at least 4 to 6 hours of bright sunlight per day to encourage flowering. Your cactus&apos; soil must be well-draining. Cactus should be repotted at least once a year to give them fresh soil and to check their roots to ensure that they’re healthy. To encourage new growth and flowering, regularly feed your cactus with a low-nitrogen or cactus blend fertilizer every few weeks throughout Spring and Summer, when it is actively growing.</j.0:plantMaintenance>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Hops are the flowers (also called seed cones or strobiles) of the hop plant Humulus lupulus, a member of the Cannabaceae family of flowering plants. They are used primarily as a bittering, flavouring, and stability agent in beer, to which, in addition to bitterness, they impart floral, fruity, or citrus flavours and aromas. Hops are also used for various purposes in other beverages and herbal medicine. The hops plants have separate female and male plants, and only female plants are used for commercial production. The hop plant is a vigorous, climbing, herbaceous perennial, usually trained to grow up strings in a field called a hopfield, hop garden (in the South of England), or hop yard (in the West Country and United States) when grown commercially. Many different varieties of hops are grown by farmers around the world, with different types used for particular styles of beer. The first documented use of hops in beer is from the 9th century, though Hildegard of Bingen, 300 years later, is often cited as the earliest documented source. Before this period, brewers used a &quot;gruit&quot;, composed of a wide variety of bitter herbs and flowers, including dandelion, burdock root, marigold, horehound (the old German name for horehound, Berghopfen, means &quot;mountain hops&quot;), ground ivy, and heather. Early documents include mention of a hop garden in the will of Charlemagne&apos;s father, Pepin the Short. Hops are also used in brewing for their antibacterial effect over less desirable microorganisms and for purported benefits including balancing the sweetness of the malt with bitterness and a variety of flavours and aromas. Historically, traditional herb combinations for beers were believed to have been abandoned when beers made with hops were noticed to be less prone to spoilage.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>The Hundred-Horse Chestnut (Italian: Castagno dei Cento Cavalli; Sicilian: Castagnu dî Centu Cavaddi) is the largest and oldest known chestnut tree in the world. Located on Linguaglossa road in Sant&apos;Alfio, on the eastern slope of Mount Etna in Sicily — only 8 km (5.0 mi) from the volcano&apos;s crater — it is generally believed to be 2,000 to 4,000 years old (4,000 according to botanist Bruno Peyronel from Turin). It is a sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa, family Fagaceae). Guinness World Records has listed it for the record of &quot;Greatest Tree Girth Ever&quot;, noting that it had a circumference of 57.9 m (190 ft) when it was measured in 1780. Above ground, the tree has since split into multiple large trunks, but below ground, these trunks still share the same roots. The tree&apos;s name originated from a legend in which a queen of Aragon and her company of 100 knights, during a trip to Mount Etna, were caught in a severe thunderstorm. The entire company is said to have taken shelter under the tree.</j.0:plantDescription>
        <j.0:plantDiseases>Anthracnose fungus disease occurs in the late spring and early summer, especially if spring is cool and wet. Anthracnose is most prominent on the lower half of the tree and shows spots or lesions that range from tan to reddish brown or black. Root feeding is strongly recommended to help the tree combat the disease.
Dutch Elm disease is the most destructive shade tree disease. Dutch elm disease causes serious economic and aesthetic losses in cities and towns where the elms are the principal shade tree.
Poplar Cankers is a fungus disease whose activity results in cankers or physical deformities.</j.0:plantDiseases>

        <j.0:plantMaintenance>Schedule a cleanup for dead, diseased and cluttered branches. It’s easy to spot cluttered branches. They’ll grow at odd angles, grow inward toward the tree’s center, or brush too closely against other branches.
Never cut a branch flush to its trunk. Prune above the branch bark ridge and branch collar. Cutting a tree limb flush to the trunk compromises the tree’s ability to heal and fight off disease.
Use the right pruning tools for the job. Use a hand pruner for branches under 1/2&quot;.  Use loppers to cut branches up to 1”.  A pruning hand saw be used for branches over 1/2”. But never use a carpenter’s saw.</j.0:plantMaintenance>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Hybrid tea is an informal horticultural classification for a group of garden roses. The first hybrid tea roses were created in France in the mid-1800s, by cross-breeding the large, floriferous Hybrid Perpetuals with the tall, elegant Tea roses. The Hybrid tea is the oldest class of Modern garden roses. Hybrid teas exhibit traits midway between their parents, being hardier than the often delicate Tea roses, and with a better ability for repeat-flowering than the more robust Hybrid Perpetuals. Hybrid tea flowers are well-formed with large, high-centred buds, supported by long, straight and upright stems. Each flower can grow to 8–12.5 cm wide. Hybrid teas are the largest and most popular group of rose, due to their elegant form and large variety of colours. Their flowers are usually borne singly at the end of long stems which also makes them very popular as cut flowers.</j.0:plantDescription>
        <j.0:plantDiseases>Black Spot (Diplocarpon rosae): Circular black spots with fringed edges on leaves, yellowing of affected leaves, and premature leaf drop. Prevention/Treatment: Plant disease-resistant rose varieties, provide good air circulation, and use fungicides.
Powdery Mildew (Podosphaera spp.): White, powdery substance on leaves and stems, leading to distorted growth. Prevention/Treatment: Plant in sunny locations with good air circulation, avoid overcrowding, and use fungicides.
Rust (Phragmidium spp.): Orange to rust-colored pustules on the undersides of leaves, causing yellow spots on the upper side. Prevention/Treatment: Remove affected leaves, provide good air circulation, and use fungicides.
Botrytis Blight (Botrytis cinerea): Grayish-brown fuzzy mold on petals and flower buds, often affecting plants in humid conditions. Prevention/Treatment: Provide good air circulation, avoid overhead watering, and remove affected plant parts.

        <j.0:plantDescription>Jasminocereus (meaning &quot;jasmine-like cereus&quot;, referring to the flowers) is a genus of cacti with only one species, Jasminocereus thouarsii, endemic to the Galápagos Islands, territorially a part of Ecuador. In English it is often called the candelabra cactus (a name used for other cacti with a similar appearance). At maturity it has a branched, treelike habit, and may be up to 7 m (23 ft) tall. The stems are made up of individual sections with constrictions between them. Its creamy white to greenish flowers open at night and are followed by greenish to reddish fruits.</j.0:plantDescription>
        <j.0:plantDiseases>Although most problems associated with cacti and succulents grown as houseplants are bacterial or fungal diseases caused by overwatering, they do get the occasional insect pest like mealy bugs, and root mealybugs.
Cochinealis usually found on cactus of the Opuntia genera like  Angel Wing or  Rufida Minima Cinnamon cactus and can be treated using only a spray of water.
Corking is an entirely natural occurrence with cactus and will not cause any harm. This is simply an indication that your plant has lived and grown large enough to require a little extra care.</j.0:plantDiseases>

        <j.0:plantMaintenance>Just like with succulents, cacti need regular watering to help them grow during their active season. As a general rule of thumb, it is best to provide cacti with at least 4 to 6 hours of bright sunlight per day to encourage flowering. Your cactus&apos; soil must be well-draining. Cactus should be repotted at least once a year to give them fresh soil and to check their roots to ensure that they’re healthy. To encourage new growth and flowering, regularly feed your cactus with a low-nitrogen or cactus blend fertilizer every few weeks throughout Spring and Summer, when it is actively growing.</j.0:plantMaintenance>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Lavandula dentata, Lavanda de la brecha (Spain), fringed lavender or French lavender, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lamiaceae, native to the Mediterranean, the Atlantic islands and the Arabian peninsula. Growing to 60 cm (24 in) tall, it has gray-green, linear or lance-shaped leaves with toothed edges and a lightly woolly texture. The long-lasting, narrow spikes of purple flowers, topped with pale violet bracts, first appear in late spring. The whole plant is strongly aromatic with the typical lavender fragrance. Its native habitat includes low hills with limestone substrates amidst other shrubs. It is present on Madeira and the Canary Islands. One of several species known by the English common name French lavender (see also Lavandula stoechas), it is commonly grown as an ornamental plant and its essential oil is used in perfumes. Like other lavenders, it is particularly associated with dry, sunny, well-drained conditions in alkaline soil. But it will tolerate a range of conditions, though it may be short-lived. The cultivar L. dentata var. dentata &apos;Royal Crown&apos; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&apos;s Award of Garden Merit. It requires some shelter in frost-prone areas.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>A lawn is an area of soil-covered land planted with grasses and other durable plants such as clover which are maintained at a short height with a lawnmower (or sometimes grazing animals) and used for aesthetic and recreational purposes. Lawns are usually composed only of grass species, subject to weed and pest control, maintained in a green color (e.g., by watering), and are regularly mowed to ensure an acceptable length. Lawns are used around houses, apartments, commercial buildings and offices. Many city parks also have large lawn areas. In recreational contexts, the specialised names turf, pitch, field or green may be used, depending on the sport and the continent. The term &quot;lawn&quot;, referring to a managed grass space, dates to at least than the 16th century. With suburban expansion, the lawn has become culturally ingrained in some areas of the world as part of the desired household aesthetic. However, awareness of the negative environmental impact of this ideal is growing. In some jurisdictions where there are water shortages, local government authorities are encouraging alternatives to lawns to reduce water use. Researchers in the United States have noted that suburban lawns are &quot;biological deserts&quot; that are contributing to a &quot;continental-scale ecological homogenization.&quot; Lawn maintenance practices also cause biodiversity loss in surrounding areas.</j.0:plantDescription>
        <j.0:plantDiseases>Volutella leaf and stem blight is the most common disease on pachysandra. The disease is usually promoted by excessive moisture for long periods of time. The fungus causes black blotches on the leaves and black cankers on the stem. To control Volutella leaf blight, avoid excess moisture from overhead irrigation. A fungicide spray program started in the spring can usually prevent the disease from spreading.
Several fungal leaf spots and a severe Xanthomonas bacterial leaf spot are possible causes for brown or black spots on English ivy.</j.0:plantDiseases>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Lemon balm (Melissa officinalis) is a perennial herbaceous plant in the mint family and native to south-central Europe, the Mediterranean Basin, Iran, and Central Asia, but now naturalised elsewhere. It grows to a maximum height of 1 m (3 ft 3 in). The leaves have a mild lemon scent. During summer, small white flowers full of nectar appear. It is not to be confused with bee balm (genus Monarda), although the white flowers attract bees, hence the genus Melissa (Greek for &quot;honey bee&quot;). The leaves are used as an herb, in teas and also as a flavouring. The plant is used to attract bees for honey production. It is grown as an ornamental plant and for its oil (to use in perfumery). Lemon balm has been cultivated at least since the 16th century.</j.0:plantDescription>

It is native to north-central Mexico (San Luis Potosi, Chihuahua). The genus is named after Maximilian Eugen Joseph (1817–1852), Duke of Leuchtenberg and amateur botanist. It is very slow-growing but can eventually grow up to 70 cm high, with a cylindrical stem which becomes bare and corky at the base with age. It has long, slender, grayish-green tubercles 6–12 cm long, with purplish-red blotches at their tips. The tubercles are topped with papery spines, making the plant resemble an agave; old, basal tubercles dry up and fall off. After four years or so, yellow, funnel-shaped flowers 5–6 cm diameter may be borne at the tubercle tips. The fruit is smooth and green, 3 cm long and 2 cm broad. It has a large, tuberous taproot.</j.0:plantDescription>

It is native throughout the cool temperate Northern Hemisphere in Asia and Europe. Convallaria majalis var. montana, also known as the American lily of the valley, is native to North America. Due to the concentration of cardiac glycosides (cardenolides), it is highly poisonous if consumed by humans or other animals. Other names include May bells, Our Lady&apos;s tears, and Mary&apos;s tears. Its French name, muguet, sometimes appears in the names of perfumes imitating the flower&apos;s scent. In pre-modern England, the plant was known as glovewort (as it was a wort used to create a salve for sore hands), or Apollinaris (according to a legend that it was discovered by Apollo).</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Pinus, the pines, is a genus of approximately 111 extant tree and shrub species. The genus is currently split into two subgenera: subgenus Pinus (hard pines), and subgenus Strobus (soft pines). Each of the subgenera have been further divided into sections based on chloroplast DNA sequencing and whole plastid genomic analysis. Older classifications split the genus into three subgenera – subgenus Pinus, subgenus Strobus, and subgenus Ducampopinus (pinyon, bristlecone and lacebark pines) – based on cone, seed and leaf characteristics. DNA phylogeny has shown that species formerly in subgenus Ducampopinus are members of subgenus Strobus, so Ducampopinus is no longer used. The species of subgenus Ducampopinus were regarded as intermediate between the other two subgenera. In the modern classification, they are placed into subgenus Strobus, yet they did not fit entirely well in either so they were classified in a third subgenus. In 1888 the Californian botanist John Gill Lemmon placed them in subgenus Pinus. In general, this classification emphasized cone, cone scale, seed, and leaf fascicle and sheath morphology, and species in each subsection were usually recognizable by their general appearance. Pines with one fibrovascular bundle per leaf, (the former subgenera Strobus and Ducampopinus) were known as haploxylon pines, while pines with two fibrovascular bundles per leaf, (subgenus Pinus) were called diploxylon pines. Diploxylon pines tend to have harder timber and a larger amount of resin than the haploxylon pines. The current division into two subgenera (Pinus and Strobus) is supported with rigorous genetic evidence. Several features are used to distinguish the subgenera, sections, and subsections of pines: the number of leaves (needles) per fascicle, whether the fascicle sheaths are deciduous or persistent, the number of fibrovascular bundles per needle (2 in Pinus or 1 in Strobus), the position of the resin ducts in the needles (internal or external), the presence or shape of the seed wings (absent, rudimentary, articulate, and adnate), and the position of the umbo (dorsal or terminal) and presence of a prickle on the scales of the seed cones. Both subgenera are thought to have a very ancient divergence from one another, having diverged during the late Jurassic.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Basil cultivars are cultivated varieties of basil. They are used in a variety of ways: as culinary herbs, landscape plants, healing herbs, teas, and worship implements. All true basils are species of the genus Ocimum. The genus is particularly diverse, and includes annuals, non-woody perennials and shrubs native to Africa and other tropical and subtropical regions of the Old and New World. Although it is estimated that there are 50 to 150 species of basil, most, but not all, culinary basils are cultivars of O. basilicum, or sweet basil. Some are cultivars of other basil species, and others are hybrids. It is particularly challenging to determine which species a basil belongs to. This is because basil cross-breeds easily, and drawing boundaries between species is particularly difficult. In fact, recent studies have led to reclassification of some portions of the genus. Basil cultivars vary in several ways. Visually, the size and shape of the leaves varies greatly, from the large lettuce-like leaves of the Mammoth basil and Lettuce leaf basil to the tiny leaves of the Dwarf bush basil. More practically, the fragrance of the basil varies due to the varying types and quantities of essential oils contained in the plants. The most important are 1,8 cineol, linalool, citral, methyl chavicol (estragole), eugenol and methyl cinnamate, although hardly any basil contains all of these in any significant amount.</j.0:plantDescription>

Use a watering schedule that allows the soil to dry out slightly between waterings to prevent overwatering and root rot.Understand the sunlight needs of each ornamental plant. Some prefer full sun, while others thrive in partial or full shade. Incorporate organic matter, such as compost, into the soil for improved fertility.</j.0:plantMaintenance>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Malephora crocea is a species of flowering plant in the ice plant family known by the common name coppery mesemb and red ice plant. It is native to Africa and it is grown in many other places as an ornamental plant and a groundcover. In California and Baja California this is an introduced species and often a noxious weed in coastal habitat such as beaches and bluffs. It is planted along highways in California and in Arizona it is utilized in landscaping for its low water needs and tolerance of sun. It has been recommended as a groundcover in areas prone to wildfire in southern California due to its low flammability. This is a perennial herb with a creeping corky to woody stem which roots where nodes come in contact with soil. The succulent leaves are triangular in cross-section, a few centimeters long, pale green to reddish in color, and somewhat waxy in texture. The flower is borne on a short stalk. It has many narrow petals in shades of red, orange, and yellow, sometimes with purplish undersides. The fruit is a valved capsule containing many lens-shaped seeds.</j.0:plantDescription>
        <j.0:plantDiseases>Volutella leaf and stem blight is the most common disease on pachysandra. The disease is usually promoted by excessive moisture for long periods of time. The fungus causes black blotches on the leaves and black cankers on the stem. To control Volutella leaf blight, avoid excess moisture from overhead irrigation. A fungicide spray program started in the spring can usually prevent the disease from spreading.
Several fungal leaf spots and a severe Xanthomonas bacterial leaf spot are possible causes for brown or black spots on English ivy.</j.0:plantDiseases>

Fertilize ornamental plants with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season. Provide winter protection for ornamental plants that are not cold-hardy in your region. Water ornamental plants based on their specific requirements. Use a watering schedule that allows the soil to dry out slightly between waterings to prevent overwatering and root rot.Understand the sunlight needs of each ornamental plant. Some prefer full sun, while others thrive in partial or full shade. Incorporate organic matter, such as compost, into the soil for improved fertility.</j.0:plantMaintenance>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Melilotus, known as melilot, sweet clover, and kumoniga (from the Cumans), is a genus in the family Fabaceae (the same family that also includes the Trifolium clovers). Members are known as common grassland plants and as weeds of cultivated ground. Originally from Europe and Asia, it is now found worldwide. This legume is commonly named for its sweet smell, which is due to the presence of coumarin in its tissues. Coumarin, though responsible for the sweet smell of hay and newly mowed grass, has a bitter taste, and, as such, possibly acts as a means for the plant to discourage consumption by animals. Fungi (including Penicillium, Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Mucor) can convert coumarin into dicoumarol, a toxic anticoagulant. Consequently, dicoumarol may be found in decaying sweet-clover, and was the cause of the so-called sweet-clover disease, recognized in cattle in the 1920s. A few varieties of sweet clover have been developed with low coumarin content and are safer for forage and silage. The name sweet clover varies orthographically (sweet-clover, sweetclover).</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Melilotus albus, known as honey clover, white melilot (UK), Bokhara clover (Australia), white sweetclover (USA), and sweet clover, is a nitrogen-fixing legume in the family Fabaceae. Melilotus albus is considered a valuable honey plant and source of nectar and is often grown for forage. Its characteristic sweet odor, intensified by drying, is derived from coumarin. Melilotus albus is of Eurasian origin but can now be found throughout the subtropical to temperate zones, especially in North America, and is common in sand dune, prairie, bunchgrass, meadow, and riparian habitats. This species is listed as an &quot;exotic pest&quot; in Tennessee, &quot;ecologically invasive&quot; in Wisconsin, and a &quot;weed&quot; in Kentucky and Quebec.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Mistletoe is the common name for obligate hemiparasitic plants in the order Santalales. They are attached to their host tree or shrub by a structure called the haustorium, through which they extract water and nutrients from the host plant. The name mistletoe originally referred to the species Viscum album (European mistletoe, of the family Santalaceae in the order Santalales); it is the only species native to the British Isles and much of Europe. A related species with red rather than white fruits, Viscum cruciatum, occurs in Southwest Spain and Southern Portugal, as well as in Morocco in North Africa and in southern Africa. The genus Viscum is not native to North America, but Viscum album was introduced to Northern California in 1900. The eastern mistletoe native to North America, Phoradendron leucarpum, belongs to a distinct genus of the family Santalaceae. European mistletoe has smooth-edged, oval, evergreen leaves borne in pairs along the woody stem, and waxy, white berries that it bears in clusters of two to six. The eastern mistletoe of North America is similar, but has shorter, broader leaves and longer clusters of 10 or more berries. Over the centuries, the term has been broadened to include many other species of parasitic plants with similar habits, found in other parts of the world, that are classified in different genera and families such as the Misodendraceae of South America and the mainly southern hemisphere tropical Loranthaceae.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>The mustard plant is any one of several plant species in the genera Brassica and Sinapis in the family Brassicaceae (the mustard family). Mustard seed is used as a spice. Grinding and mixing the seeds with water, vinegar, or other liquids creates the yellow condiment known as prepared mustard. The seeds can also be pressed to make mustard oil, and the edible leaves can be eaten as mustard greens. Many vegetables are cultivated varieties of mustard plants; domestication may have begun 6,000 years ago.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Nandina domestica (/nænˈdiːnə/ nan-DEE-nə) commonly known as nandina, heavenly bamboo or sacred bamboo, is a species of flowering plant in the family Berberidaceae, native to eastern Asia from the Himalayas to Japan. It is the only member of the monotypic genus Nandina. It is widely grown in gardens as an ornamental plant with a number of cultivars that display bright-red fall foliage in the cool months, and attractive new foliage growth in spring. Although a popular ornamental shrub, the berries are toxic to birds, especially towards the end of the winter when other food sources become scarce. The Latin genus name Nandina is derived from the Japanese name nanten. The specific epithet domestica means &apos;domesticated&apos;, or &apos;of the household&apos;.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Nepenthes boschiana (/nɪˈpɛnθiːz ˌbɒʃiˈɑːnə/; after Johannes van den Bosch), or Bosch&apos;s pitcher-plant, is a tropical pitcher plant endemic to Borneo. It is most closely allied to N. faizaliana. Nepenthes borneensis is considered a synonym of this species. Nepenthes boschiana has no known natural hybrids. No valid forms or varieties have been described. Nepenthes boschiana belongs to the loosely defined &quot;N. maxima complex&quot;, which also includes, among other species, N. chaniana, N. epiphytica, N. eymae, N. faizaliana, N. fusca, N. klossii, N. maxima, N. platychila, N. stenophylla, and N. vogelii. The species was formally described by Pieter Willem Korthals in his 1839 monograph, &quot;Over het geslacht Nepenthes&quot;. B. H. Danser, in his 1928 monograph &quot;The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies&quot;, wrote the following: Korthals states the natives who accompanied him on Mt. Sakoembang gathered the not yet opened pitchers, as the water which they contained was a medicament against inflammation of the eyes, whereas others cut the opened pitchers as playthings for their children. He describes the habitat as sterile, open and stony. The vernacular name &apos;daoen sompitan&apos; is translated by him as blow-pipe-leaf; according to dictionaries this is right.

        <j.0:plantDescription>Ophiopogon (lilyturf) is a genus of evergreen perennial plants native to warm temperate to tropical East, Southeast, and South Asia. Despite their grasslike appearance, they are not closely related to the true grasses, the Poaceae. The name of the genus is derived from Greek Όφις ophis, &quot;snake&quot;, and πόγὦν pogon, &quot;beard&quot;, most probably referring to its leaves and tufted growth. In the APG III classification system, it is placed in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Nolinoideae (formerly the family Ruscaceae). Like many lilioid monocots, it was formerly classified in the Liliaceae. They grow from short rhizomes, and bear tufts of leaves, from which flowers emerge in racemes held on short stems above the leaves. Species 1.

        <j.0:plantDiseases>Volutella leaf and stem blight is the most common disease on pachysandra. The disease is usually promoted by excessive moisture for long periods of time. The fungus causes black blotches on the leaves and black cankers on the stem. To control Volutella leaf blight, avoid excess moisture from overhead irrigation. A fungicide spray program started in the spring can usually prevent the disease from spreading.
Several fungal leaf spots and a severe Xanthomonas bacterial leaf spot are possible causes for brown or black spots on English ivy.</j.0:plantDiseases>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Opuntia ficus-indica, the Indian fig opuntia, fig opuntia, or prickly pear, is a species of cactus that has long been a domesticated crop plant grown in agricultural economies throughout arid and semiarid parts of the world. O. ficus-indica is the most widespread and most commercially important cactus. It is grown primarily as a fruit crop, and also for the vegetable nopales and other uses. Cacti are good crops for dry areas because they convert water into biomass efficiently. O. ficus-indica, as the most widespread of the long-domesticated cactuses, is as economically important as maize and blue agave in Mexico. Opuntia species hybridize easily, but the wild origin of O. ficus-indica is likely to have been in central Mexico where its closest genetic relatives are found.</j.0:plantDescription>

It was native to the Mediterranean region, but widely naturalised elsewhere in the temperate Northern Hemisphere. Oregano is a woody perennial plant, growing 20–80 cm (8–31 in) tall, with opposite leaves 1–4 cm (1⁄2–1+1⁄2 in) long. The flowers are purple, 3–4 mm (1⁄8–3⁄16 in) long, produced in erect spikes in summer. It is sometimes called wild marjoram, and its close relative, O. majorana, is known as sweet marjoram. Both are widely used as culinary herbs, especially in Turkish, Greek, Spanish, Italian, Mexican, and French cuisine.

        <j.0:plantDescription>Ornamental plants or garden plants are plants that are primarily grown for their beauty but also for qualities such as scent or how they shape physical space. Many are flowering plants, and garden varieties tend to be specially bred cultivars that improve on the original species in qualities such as colour, shape, scent and long-lasting blooms. There are many examples of fine ornamental plants that can provide height, privacy, and beauty for any garden. These ornamental perennial plants have seeds that allow them to reproduce. One of the beauties of ornamental grasses is that they are very versatile and low maintenance. Almost any types of plants have ornamental varieties: trees, shrubs, climbers, grasses, succulents. aquatic plants, herbasceous perennials and annual plants. Non-botanical classifications include houseplants, bedding plants, hedges, plants for cut flowers and foliage plants. The cultivation of ornamental plants comes under floriculture and tree nurseries, which is a major branch of horticulture. Commonly, ornamental garden plants are grown for the display of aesthetic features including: flowers, leaves, scent, overall foliage texture, fruit, stem and bark, and aesthetic form. In some cases, unusual features may be considered to be of interest, such as the prominent thorns of Rosa sericea and cacti.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Oxalis acetosella, the wood sorrel or common wood sorrel, is a rhizomatous flowering plant in the family Oxalidaceae, common in most of Europe and parts of Asia. The specific epithet acetosella refers to its sour taste. The common name wood sorrel is often used for other plants in the genus Oxalis. In much of its range it is the only member of its genus and hence simply known as &quot;the&quot; wood sorrel. While common wood sorrel may be used to differentiate it from most other species of Oxalis, in North America, Oxalis montana is also called common wood sorrel. It is also known as Alleluia because it blossoms between Easter and Pentecost, when the Psalms which end with Hallelujah are sung.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Parsley, or garden parsley (Petroselinum crispum) is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae that is native to the central and eastern Mediterranean region (Sardinia, Lebanon, Israel, Cyprus, Turkey, southern Italy, Greece, Portugal, Spain, Malta, Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia), but has been naturalized elsewhere in Europe, and is widely cultivated as a herb, and a vegetable. Parsley is widely used in European, Middle Eastern, and American cuisine. Curly leaf parsley is often used as a garnish. In central Europe, eastern Europe, and southern Europe, as well as in western Asia, many dishes are served with fresh green chopped parsley sprinkled on top. Flat leaf parsley is similar, but it is easier to cultivate, some say it has a stronger flavor. Root parsley is very common in central, eastern, and southern European cuisines, where it is used as a snack or a vegetable in many soups, stews, and casseroles. It is believed to have been originally grown in Sardinia (Mediterranean area) and was cultivated in around the 3rd century BC. Linnaeus stated its wild habitat to be Sardinia, whence it was brought to England and apparently first cultivated in Britain in 1548, though literary evidence suggests parsley was used in England in the Middle Ages, as early as the Anglo-Saxon period.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>The parsnip (Pastinaca sativa) is a root vegetable closely related to carrot and parsley, all belonging to the flowering plant family Apiaceae. It is a biennial plant usually grown as an annual. Its long taproot has cream-colored skin and flesh, and, left in the ground to mature, it becomes sweeter in flavor after winter frosts. In its first growing season, the plant has a rosette of pinnate, mid-green leaves. If unharvested, in its second growing season it produces a flowering stem topped by an umbel of small yellow flowers, later producing pale brown, flat, winged seeds. By this time, the stem has become woody and the tap root inedible. The parsnip is native to Eurasia; it has been used as a vegetable since antiquity and was cultivated by the Romans, although some confusion exists between parsnips and carrots in the literature of the time. It was used as a sweetener before the arrival of cane sugar in Europe. Parsnips are usually cooked, but can also be eaten raw. The flesh has a sweet flavor, even more so than carrots, but the taste is different. It is high in vitamins, antioxidants, and minerals (especially potassium); and also contains both soluble and insoluble dietary fiber. Parsnips are best cultivated in deep, stone-free soil. The plant is attacked by the carrot fly and other insect pests, as well as viruses and fungal diseases, of which canker is the most serious. Handling the stems and foliage can cause a skin rash if the skin is exposed to sunlight after handling.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Penstemon /ˈpɛnstɪmən/, the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 250 species of flowering plants native mostly to the Nearctic, but with a few species also found in the North American portion of the Neotropics. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. They have opposite leaves, partly tube-shaped, and two-lipped flowers and seed capsules. The most distinctive feature of the genus is the prominent staminode, an infertile stamen. The staminode takes a variety of forms in the different species; while typically a long straight filament extending to the mouth of the corolla, some are longer and extremely hairy, giving the general appearance of an open mouth with a fuzzy tongue protruding and inspiring the common name beardtongue. Most penstemons are deciduous or semi-evergreen perennials, the remainder being shrubs or subshrubs. Heights can range from 10 cm to as much as 3 metres. The one Asiatic species previously treated in Penstemon is now placed in a separate genus Pennellianthus. This leaves Penstemon a mostly Nearctic genus, with a few neotropical species. Although widespread across North America, and found in habitats ranging from open desert to moist forests, and up to the alpine zone, they are not typically common within their range.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Peppermint (Mentha × piperita) is a hybrid species of mint, a cross between watermint and spearmint. Indigenous to Europe and the Middle East, the plant is now widely spread and cultivated in many regions of the world. It is occasionally found in the wild with its parent species. Although the genus Mentha comprises more than 25 species, the one in most common use is peppermint. While Western peppermint is derived from Mentha × piperita, Chinese peppermint, or bohe, is derived from the fresh leaves of M. haplocalyx. M. × piperita and M. haplocalyx are both recognized as plant sources of menthol and menthone, and are among the oldest herbs used for both culinary and medicinal products.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDiseases>Volutella leaf and stem blight is the most common disease on pachysandra. The disease is usually promoted by excessive moisture for long periods of time. The fungus causes black blotches on the leaves and black cankers on the stem. To control Volutella leaf blight, avoid excess moisture from overhead irrigation. A fungicide spray program started in the spring can usually prevent the disease from spreading.
Several fungal leaf spots and a severe Xanthomonas bacterial leaf spot are possible causes for brown or black spots on English ivy.</j.0:plantDiseases>

It has branchlets that typically hang downwards, and the largest cones of any spruce, 9–17 cm long. It is very closely related to the Siberian spruce (Picea obovata), which replaces it east of the Ural Mountains, and with which it hybridizes freely. The Norway spruce has a wide distribution for it being planted for its wood, and is the species used as the main Christmas tree in several countries around the world. It was the first gymnosperm to have its genome sequenced. The Latin specific epithet abies means “like Abies, Fir tree”</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Picea chihuahuana, the Chihuahua spruce, is a medium-sized evergreen tree growing to 25–35 m tall, and with a trunk diameter of up to 1 m. It is native to northwest Mexico, where it occurs in 25 small populations in the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains in Chihuahua and Durango. It grows at moderate altitudes from 2300–3200 m, growing along streamsides in mountain valleys, where moisture levels in the soil are greater than the otherwise low rainfall in the area would suggest. The bark is thin and scaly, flaking off in small circular plates 5–10 cm across. The crown is conic, with widely spaced branches with drooping branchlets. The shoots are stout, pale buff-brown, glabrous, and with prominent pulvini. The leaves are needle-like, 17–23 mm long, stout, rhombic in cross-section, bright glaucous blue-green with conspicuous lines of stomata; the tip is viciously sharp. The cones are pendulous, broad cylindrical, 7–12 cm long and 3 cm broad when closed, opening to 4–5 cm broad. They have stiff, bluntly rounded scales 1.5–2 cm broad, and are green, maturing pale brown 6–8 months after pollination. The seeds are black, 4 mm long, with a 10–13 mm long pale brown wing. Chihuahua spruce was only discovered in 1942 by the Mexican botanist , and is endangered with just 25 small populations, none comprising more than a few hundred trees. It is related to Martinez Spruce from northeast Mexico, but differs in the shorter, blue-green leaves, and the smaller, narrower cones with smaller scales. No other related spruces are found in North America, with its next-closest relatives in eastern Asia. It is a very attractive tree and is starting to be planted as an ornamental tree in botanical gardens, particularly valued in warm areas as it is one of the most heat-tolerant of all spruces, more tolerant of summer heat than Blue Spruce, which it resembles in foliage.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Picea critchfieldii (common name: Critchfield&apos;s spruce) is an extinct species of spruce tree formerly present on the landscape of North America, where it was once widely distributed throughout the southeastern United States. Plant macrofossil evidence reveals that this tree became extinct during the Late Quaternary period of Earth&apos;s history. At present, this is the only documented plant extinction from this geologic era. Hypotheses as to what specifically drove the extinction remain unresolved, but rapid and widespread climatic changes coincided with Picea critchfieldii&apos;s decline and ultimate extinction.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Picea jezoensis (sometimes misspelled Picea yezoensis), the dark-bark spruce, Ezo spruce, Yezo spruce, or Jezo spruce, is a large evergreen tree growing to 30–50 m tall and with a trunk diameter of up to 2 m. It is native to northeast Asia, from the mountains of central Japan and the Changbai Mountains on the China-North Korea border, north to eastern Siberia, including the Sikhote-Alin, Kuril Islands, Sakhalin and Kamchatka. It is found in cold but humid temperate rain forests, and nowhere does its range extend more than 400 km from the Pacific Ocean. The specific epithet jezoensis derives from Ezo, an old name for Hokkaido and other islands north of the Japanese island of Honshu, where the species is found. The bark is thin and scaly, becoming fissured in old trees. The crown is broad conic. The shoots are pale buff-brown, glabrous (hairless) but with prominent pulvini. The leaves are needle-like, 15–20 mm long, 2 mm broad, flattened in cross-section, dark green above with no stomata, and blue-white to white below with two dense bands of stomata. The cones are pendulous, slender cylindrical, 4–7 cm long and 2 cm broad when closed, opening to 3 cm broad. They have thin, flexible scales 12–18 mm long. They are green or reddish, maturing pale brown 5–6 months after pollination. The seeds are black, 3 mm long, with a slender, 6–8 mm long pale brown wing. There are two geographical subspecies, treated as varieties by some authors, and as distinct species by others: 
* Picea jezoensis subsp. jezoensis (Ezo spruce). All of the range except as below, south to Hokkaidō, Japan. Shoots very pale buff-brown, almost white; stomatal bands blue-white; cones pale brown with flexible scales. 
* Picea jezoensis subsp. hondoensis (Mayr) P. A. Schmidt (Hondo spruce). An isolated southern population on high mountains in central Honshū, Japan. Shoots buff-brown to orange-brown, less often very pale; stomatal bands bright white; cones orange-brown with stiffer scales. Ezo spruce is very closely related to Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), which replaces it on the opposite side of the north Pacific. They, particularly subsp. jezoensis, can be difficult to distinguish, with the absence of stomata on the upper surface of the leaves of P. jezoensis being the best feature. Its leaves are also somewhat blunter, less sharply spine-tipped, than Sitka Spruce.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Picea martinezii, the Martinez spruce, is a medium-sized evergreen tree growing to 25–35 m tall, and with a trunk diameter of up to 1 m. It is native to northeast Mexico, where it occurs at two localities in the Sierra Madre Oriental mountains in Nuevo León. It grows at moderate altitudes from 2150–2600 m, growing along streamsides in mountain valleys, where moisture levels in the soil are greater than the otherwise low rainfall in the area would suggest. The bark is thin and scaly, flaking off in small circular plates 5–10 cm across. The crown is conic, with widely spaced branches with drooping branchlets. The shoots are stout, pale buff-brown, glabrous, and with prominent pulvini. The leaves are needle-like, 23–35 mm long, stout, moderately flattened in cross-section, bright glossy green with inconspicuous lines of stomata; the tip is viciously sharp. The cones are pendulous, broad cylindrical, 8–16 cm long and 3 cm broad when closed, opening to 6 cm broad. They have stiff, smoothly rounded scales 2-2.5 cm broad, and are green, maturing pale brown 6–8 months after pollination. The seeds are black, 4 mm long, with a 12–16 mm long pale brown wing. Martinez spruce was only discovered in 1981, and is critically endangered with just two small populations, comprising a few hundred trees and a dozen trees respectively. Fossil evidence shows it had a wider distribution in the past, south to central Mexico. It is related to Chihuahua spruce from northwest Mexico, but differs in the longer, green leaves, and the larger, broader cones with larger scales. No other related spruces are found in North America, with its next-closest relatives in eastern Asia. It is a very attractive tree and is starting to be planted as an ornamental tree in botanical gardens, particularly valued in warm areas as it is one of the most heat-tolerant of all spruces. It is named after the Mexican botanist .</j.0:plantDescription>

It shares the common name &quot;creeping pine&quot; with several other plants. The whitebark pine is typically the highest-elevation pine tree found in these mountain ranges and often marks the tree line. Thus, it is often found as krummholz, trees growing close to the ground that have been dwarfed by exposure.

        <j.0:plantDescription>Pinus ayacahuite, also called ayacahuite pine and Mexican white pine, (family Pinaceae) is a species of pine native to the mountains of southern Mexico and western Central America, in the Sierra Madre del Sur mountains and the eastern end of the Eje Volcánico Transversal, between 14° and 21°N latitude in the Mexican states of Guerrero, Oaxaca, Puebla, Veracruz and Chiapas, and in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. It grows on relatively moist areas with summer rainfalls, however specimens from its eastern and southern distribution live under really wet conditions; it needs full sun and well drained soils. Its temperature needs fluctuate between 19 and 10 °C on average a year. This tree accepts from subtropical to cool climate. Pinus ayacahuite is a large tree, regularly growing to 30–45 m and exceptionally up to 50 m tall. It is a member of the white pine group, Pinus subgenus Strobus, and like all members of that group, the leaves (&apos;needles&apos;) are in fascicles (bundles) of five, with a deciduous sheath. The needles are finely serrated, and 9–16 cm long. The cones are long and slender, 15–40 cm long and 4–6 cm broad (closed), opening to 6–10 cm broad; the scales are thin and flexible. The seeds are small, 6–8 mm long, and have a long slender wing 18–25 mm long. It is moderately susceptible to white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola), but in cultivation has proved somewhat less susceptible than most other American white pines (see e.g. western white pine, sugar pine).</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Pinus bhutanica, which may be called the Bhutan white pine, is a tree restricted to Bhutan and adjacent parts of northeast India (Arunachal Pradesh) and southwest China (Yunnan and Tibet). Along with the related Pinus wallichiana it is a constituent of lower altitude blue pine forests. This pine reaches a height of 25 meters. Note that P. wallichiana is sometimes called by the common name &apos;Bhutan pine&apos;. The needles are in bundles of five, up to 25 cm long. The cones are 12–20 cm in length, with thin scales; the seeds are 5–6 mm long, with a 20–25 mm wing. It differs from P. wallichiana in the much longer, strongly drooping needles, and the cones being slightly smaller and red-brown, rather than yellow-buff, when mature. It is also adapted to generally warmer, wetter climates at lower altitudes, with an intense summer monsoon. Despite the two being closely related and at least occasionally growing together, no hybrids or intermediates have ever been reported.</j.0:plantDescription>

Modern systematic studies recognize P. cubensis it as a valid species, nevertheless, there is disagreement about whether the Sierra Maestra populations in the south are part of P. cubensis or conform another species named P. maestrensis. The Sierra Nipe-Cristal and Sierra Maestra population may have diverged recently, as indicated by recent genetic studies that have found some ancestral genetic lineages that are shared among the two regions and only some rare variants exclusive for each region.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Pinus devoniana is a species of conifer in the family Pinaceae. It is found in more than 15 states of Mexico - from S. Sinaloa to Chiapas - and Guatemala in montane, relatively open pine or pine-oak forests at altitudes from 900 to 2,500 m (3,000 to 8,200 ft). Pinus devoniana, which is locally called “pino blanco”, “pino lacio” or “pino prieto”, is a tree of medium size, which can grow 20–30 m (66–98 ft) tall, with a dbh to 80–100 cm (31–39 in). It has curved foliage twigs and very long needles, from 25–40 cm (9.8–15.7 in), in fascicles of 5. The cones, which grow solitary or in whorls of 2-4 on thick, short peduncles, leaving a few scales on the branch when falling, are usually large and often curved, 15–35 cm (5.9–13.8 in) long and 8–15 cm (3.1–5.9 in) wide when open. Pinus devoniana is closely related to Pinus montezumae (the Montezuma pine). These species are sometimes difficult to distinguish, while hybrids probably occur. The cones are especially variable. Overall, both foliage and cones are larger in Pinus devoniana.

Other common names include swamp pine, yellow slash pine, and southern Florida pine. Slash pine has two different varieties: P. e. var. elliottii and P. e. var. densa. Historically, slash pine has been an important economic timber for naval stores, turpentine, and resin. The wood of slash pine is known for its unusually high strength, especially for a pine. It exceeds many hardwoods and is even comparable to very dense woods such as ironwood.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Pinus engelmannii, commonly known as the Apache pine, is a tree of Northern Mexico, in the Sierra Madre Occidental with its range extending a short distance into the United States in southwestern New Mexico and southeastern Arizona. This pine is a medium-sized species with a height of 20–30 metres (66–98 feet) and a trunk diameter of 35–80 centimetres (14–31 inches). The branches are sparse and very stout, giving the tree a distinct appearance. The needles, among the longest of any pine, are in bundles of three (occasionally five), 20–40 cm (8–16 in) long, stout, and spreading to slightly drooping. The cones are 8–16 cm (3+1⁄4–6+1⁄4 in) long, green or purple when growing, maturing glossy brown, moderately oblique with stoutly spined scales on the outer side (facing away from the branch). The Apache pine sometimes shows a grass stage like the related Michoacan pine (P. devoniana) and also longleaf pine (P. palustris). The English name refers to the species&apos; occurrence in the lands of the Apache Native Americans, while the scientific name commemorates the pioneering American botanist George Engelmann who discovered the species in 1848. Engelmann first named the species Pinus macrophylla, but this name had already been used for another pine, so it had to be renamed; this was done by the French botanist Carrière, who chose to honour Engelmann. Apache pine was sometimes treated as a variety of ponderosa pine in the past (as P. ponderosa var. mayriana), but it is now universally regarded as a distinct species.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Pinus glabra, the spruce pine, is a tree found on the coastal plains of the southern United States, from southern South Carolina south to northern Florida and west to southern Louisiana. This pine is a straight-growing, medium-sized species, attaining heights of 20 to 40 metres (66 to 131 ft). The leaves are needle-like, in bundles of two, 5-to-8-centimetre-long (2.0 to 3.1 in), slender (1-millimetre-thick (0.039 in)), and glossy dark green. The small, slender cones are 4-to-6-centimetre-long (1.6 to 2.4 in), with weak prickles on the scales that are soon shed. Pinus glabra differs markedly from most other pines in that it does not occur in largely pure pine forests, but is typically found as scattered trees in moist woodland habitats in mixed hardwood forest. To be able to compete successfully in such habitats, it has adapted to greater shade tolerance than most other pines.

        <j.0:plantDescription>Pinus muricata, the bishop pine, is a pine with a very restricted range: mostly in California, including several offshore Channel Islands, and a few locations in Baja California, Mexico. It is always on or near the coast. In San Luis Obispo County it is found alone or in stands scattered on the coastal mountains and hills from Morro Bay to Shell Beach. A few stands of the tree are seen on the hills above the Sycamore Canyon Resort in Avila Beach. Within the City of San Luis Obispo, the Terrace Hill Open Space has several scattered specimens. Bishop pine seems to prefer already disturbed, unvegetated areas where it probably faces less competition from oaks and shrubs. The common name &quot;bishop pine&quot; resulted from the tree having been first identified near the Mission of San Luis Obispo in San Luis Obispo, California. This tree has a large number of common names and other prior scientific names, due primarily to numerous variant forms. Other English names that have occasionally been used are prickle cone pine, Obispo pine, Santa Cruz pine and dwarf marine pine.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Pinus patula, commonly known as patula pine, spreading-leaved pine, or Mexican weeping pine, and in Spanish as pino patula or pino llorón, (patula Latin = “spreading”) is a tree native to the highlands of Mexico. It grows from 24° to 18° North latitude and 1,800–2,700 m (5,900–8,900 ft) above sea level. The tree grows up to 30 m (98 ft) tall. It cannot withstand long periods of temperatures as low as −10 °C (14 °F), but resists occasional brief dips below 0 °C (32 °F). It is moderately drought-tolerant, and in this respect is superior to Pinus taeda. The average annual rainfall in its native habitat is from 750 to 2000 mm. This happens mostly in summer, but in a little area of the State of Veracruz on the Sierra Madre Oriental its habitat is rainy the year round. It is planted at high altitudes in Ecuador (3500 m), Bolivia, Colombia (3300m), Kenya, Tanzania, Angola, Zimbabwe, Papua New Guinea, and Hawaii (3000 m). In Hawaii it is replacing the native alpine grassland. At lower altitudes than its origin country it is cultivated in Southern Brazil, South Africa, India, and in the Argentine provinces of Córdoba and San Luis. it is planted for forestation purposes in lands originally covered by bushland. It has been introduced near sea level in New South Wales, Australia, where it spreads naturally by wind and is very favored because rainfalls are more abundant in summer. It was also introduced in New Zealand for commercial purposes and is fully naturalized there. It is cultivated in the United Kingdom as an ornamental tree for parks and gardens, and has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&apos;s Award of Garden Merit. The timber is pale-pink to salmon, moderately soft, brittle and smelling strongly of aniseed when freshly cut.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Pinus peuce (Macedonian pine or Balkan pine) (Serbo-Croatian/Macedonian: молика, molika; Bulgarian: бяла мура, Byala mura) is a species of pine native to the mountains of Macedonia, Bulgaria, Albania, Montenegro, Kosovo, the extreme southwest of Serbia, and the extreme north of Greece, growing typically at (600-) 1,000-2,200 (-2,300) m altitude. It often reaches the alpine tree line in this area. The mature size is up to 35–40 m height, and 1.5 m trunk diameter. However, the height of the tree diminishes strongly near the upper forest limit and may even obtain shrub sizes. It is a member of the white pine group, Pinus subgenus Strobus, and like all members of that group, the leaves (&apos;needles&apos;) are in fascicles (bundles) of five, with a deciduous sheath. They are 6–11 cm long. Its pine cones are mostly 8–16 cm long, occasionally up to 20 cm long, green at first, becoming yellow-brown when mature, with broad, flat to downcurved scales. The 6–7 mm long seeds have a 2 cm wing and can be wind-dispersed, but are also very often dispersed by spotted nutcrackers.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Pinus pseudostrobus, known in English as the smooth-bark Mexican pine and in Spanish as chamite or pacingo, is a tree found in forests of Mexico and Central America. It is 8 to 25 m tall with a dense and round top.It is threatened by logging and wood harvesting. The bark is brown and fissured and smooth when young. It is subject to ex-situ conservation. It grows at altitudes between 850 and 3250 m. from 26° to 15° north latitude, from Sinaloa, Mexico to Nicaragua and Honduras. It occurs within a rainfall regime that rains mostly in summer. A stand of about 15 fully mature smooth-bark Mexican pines is in Imperial County, California, at the Palo Verde County Park, in a narrow strip of land between Hwy 78 and the Colorado River. English botanist John Lindley described the species in 1839. It is divided into Pinus pseudostrobus var.apulcensis (Lindl.)Shaw (Apulco pine), Pinus pseudostrobus f.protuberans Martínez and Pinus pseudostrobus var.pseudostrobus. It has been introduced in New Zealand near sea level and has done well.

        <j.0:plantDescription>Pinus serotina, the pond pine, marsh pine or pocosin pine, is a pine tree found along the Southeastern portion of the Atlantic coastal plain of the United States, from southern New Jersey south to Florida and west to southern Alabama. This pine often has a crooked growth pattern and an irregular top and grows up to 21 metres (69 ft) high, rarely to 29 metres (95 ft). The needles are in bundles of three or four, and 15–20 cm (6–8 in) long. The almost round cones are 5–8 cm (2–3+1⁄4 in) long with small prickles on the scales. Its cones are usually serotinous, requiring fire to open. The pond pine is found in wet habitats near ponds, bays, swamps, and pocosins. Often found among long leaf pines due to their high flammability and the pond pines need for fire to germinate. The species name serotina is derived from the persistently unopened cones that may remain closed for several years before they release their seeds; the opening is often in response to forest fires. At the north end of its range, it intergrades and hybridizes with pitch pine (P. rigida); it is distinguished from that species by the longer needles and on average slightly larger cones. Some botanists treat pond pine as a subspecies of pitch pine. 
* Pond pine cones are smaller and rounder than loblolly pine cones. 
* Unlike loblolly pines, pond pines have the ability to grow needles directly from the trunk.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Pinus virginiana, the Virginia pine, scrub pine, Jersey pine, Possum pine, is a medium-sized tree, often found on poorer soils from Long Island in southern New York south through the Appalachian Mountains to western Tennessee and Alabama. The usual size range for this pine is 9–18 m, (18–59 feet) but can grow larger under optimum conditions. The trunk can be as large as 20 inches diameter. This tree prefers well-drained loam or clay, but will also grow on very poor, sandy soil, where it remains small and stunted. The typical life span is 65 to 90 years. The short (4–8 cm), yellow-green needles are paired in fascicles and are often twisted. Pinecones are 4–7 cm long and may persist on the tree for many years, often (though not always) releasing their seeds in the second year. In growth habit, some trees may be inclined with twisted trunks. This pine is useful for reforesting and provides nourishment for wildlife. Its other main use is on Christmas tree farms, despite having sharp-tipped needles and yellowish winter color. It also can provide wood pulp and lumber. Like some other southern yellow pines, Virginia pine lumber case hardens. That is, it becomes very hard over time during wood drying. Wood from Virginia pine is not normally considered to resist rot unless treated with preservatives.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>The pinyon or piñon pine group grows in southwestern North America, especially in New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah. The trees yield edible nuts, which are a staple food of Native Americans, and widely eaten as a snack and as an ingredient in New Mexican cuisine. The name comes from the Spanish pino piñonero, a name used for both the American varieties and the stone pine common in Spain, which also produces edible nuts typical of Mediterranean cuisine. Harvesting techniques of the prehistoric American Indians are still used today to collect the pinyon seeds for personal use or for commercialization. The pinyon nut or seed is high in fats and calories. Pinyon wood, especially when burned, has a distinctive fragrance, making it a common wood to burn in chimeneas. Pinyon pine trees are also known to influence the soil in which they grow by increasing concentrations of both macronutrients and micronutrients. Some of the species are known to hybridize, the most notable ones being P. quadrifolia with P. monophylla, and P. edulis with P. monophylla. The two-needle piñon (Pinus edulis) is the official state tree of New Mexico.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDiseases>Volutella leaf and stem blight is the most common disease on pachysandra. The disease is usually promoted by excessive moisture for long periods of time. The fungus causes black blotches on the leaves and black cankers on the stem. To control Volutella leaf blight, avoid excess moisture from overhead irrigation. A fungicide spray program started in the spring can usually prevent the disease from spreading.
Several fungal leaf spots and a severe Xanthomonas bacterial leaf spot are possible causes for brown or black spots on English ivy.</j.0:plantDiseases>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Poplar Walk is wide footpath running north–south in Christ Church Meadow, Oxford, England. The footpath runs between The Meadow Building of Christ Church at the junction with Broad Walk to the north and the River Thames near Folly Bridge to the south. At this point, the river is known as &quot;The Isis&quot; and is the location of the end of rowing races for Oxford University events such as Eights Week in the summer and Torpids in the spring. There used to be ornate wooden barges on the river here to house rowing facilities and for viewing races. Now the barges are gone and there are boathouses instead a little further down the river near the junction with the River Cherwell. Poplar Walk is still used as a route to and from the boathouses. There are good rural views to the east across Christ Church Meadow, even though Poplar Walk is quite centrally located in Oxford. Poplar Walk was laid out in 1872 and lined with poplar trees by Henry Liddell, Dean of Christ Church and the father of Alice Liddell of Alice in Wonderland fame. Postwar development planned for central Oxford included a relief road passing through the northern part of Christ Church Meadow and joining the district of St Ebbe&apos;s. It would have cut off the northern end of Poplar Walk. The proposal was defeated after strong opposition.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Populus section Aigeiros is a section of three species in the genus Populus, the poplars. Like some other species in the genus Populus, they are commonly known as cottonwoods. The species are native to North America, Europe, and western Asia. In the past, as many as six species were recognized, but recent trends have been to accept just three species, treating the others as subspecies of P. deltoides. They are large, deciduous trees that are 15–30 m (50–100 ft) tall and diameters of 4 m (13 ft), distinguished by thick, deeply fissured bark and triangular-based to diamond-shaped leaves that are green on both sides (without the whitish wax on the undersides) and without any obvious balsam scent in spring. An important feature of the leaves is the petiole, which is flattened sideways so that the leaves have a particular type of movement in the wind. Male and female flowers are in separate catkins, appearing before the leaves in spring. The seeds are borne on cottony structures that allow them to be blown long distances in the air before settling to ground. The cottonwoods are exceptionally tolerant of flooding, erosion, and flood deposits filling around the trunk. Although each of the three cottonwood species has a different leaf pattern, they all have the same general diamond leaf shape.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Populus section Populus, of the Populus (poplar) genus, includes the aspen trees and the white poplar Populus alba. The five typical aspens are all native to cold regions with cool summers, in the north of the Northern Hemisphere, extending south at high altitudes in the mountains. The White Poplar, by contrast, is native to warmer regions, with hot, dry summers. These trees are all medium-sized deciduous trees ranging 15–30 metres (49–98 ft) tall. All of the species in section Populus typically grow in large clonal colonies derived from a single seedling, and spreading by means of root suckers; new stems in the colony may appear at up to 30–40 metres from the previous trees. Each individual tree can live for 40–150 years above ground, but the root system of the colony is long-lived, sending up new trunks as the older trunks die off above ground, spreading about a metre per year, sometimes eventually covering many hectares. They are able to survive forest fires because the roots are below the heat of the fire, and new sprouts can grow from the roots. One colony of American aspen (P. tremuloides) in Utah, given the nickname of &quot;Pando&quot;, has been estimated to be 80,000 years old (disputed), making it possibly the oldest living colony of aspens.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Populus tremuloides is a deciduous tree native to cooler areas of North America, one of several species referred to by the common name aspen. It is commonly called quaking aspen, trembling aspen, American aspen, mountain or golden aspen, trembling poplar, white poplar, and popple, as well as others. The trees have tall trunks, up to 25 meters (82 feet) tall, with smooth pale bark, scarred with black. The glossy green leaves, dull beneath, become golden to yellow, rarely red, in autumn. The species often propagates through its roots to form large clonal groves originating from a shared root system. These roots are not rhizomes, as new growth develops from adventitious buds on the parent root system (the ortet). Populus tremuloides is the most widely distributed tree in North America, being found from Canada to central Mexico. It is the defining species of the aspen parkland biome in the Prairie Provinces of Canada and extreme northwest Minnesota.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantMaintenance>Most herbs prefer full sunlight. Ensure your herbs receive at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day. Place potted herbs near south or west-facing windows indoors.
Use well-draining, nutrient-rich soil with good aeration. Amend the soil with organic matter like compost for improved fertility.
Water herbs consistently, keeping the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Allow the soil to dry out slightly between waterings to prevent root rot.
If growing herbs in containers, choose appropriately sized pots with drainage holes to prevent waterlogging.</j.0:plantMaintenance>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Psychotria poeppigiana is a plant species in the family Rubiaceae; a common name is sore-mouth bush, though it is not very often used. This species is currently accepted as Palicourea tomentosa based on a journal article published in 2011 (see ). It ranges widely in the tropical Americas, from Chiapas, Oaxaca, Tabasco and Veracruz in Mexico to the very north of Argentina. It does not occur on the Pacific side of the American cordillera however, and is thus absent from El Salvador and Chile. It is probably also absent from Uruguay and Paraguay. P. poeppigiana is a large shrub. The inflorescences are carried upright or semi-erect and are surrounded by large bracts, colored a conspicuous red, that attract pollinators. The flowers themselves are inconspicuous, with the small yellow petals and sepals forming a narrow corollar tube. Pollinators are mainly hummingbirds, namely small hermit (Phaethornithinae) species like the black-throated hermit (Phaethornis atrimentalis), straight-billed hermit (P. bourcieri) and reddish hermit (P. ruber). They do not insert their bills deeply into the small flowers, and thus the pollinators of the sore-mouth bush include curved- and straight-billed species alike.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Pyrethrum was a genus of several Old World plants now classified as Chrysanthemum or Tanacetum which are cultivated as ornamentals for their showy flower heads. Pyrethrum continues to be used as a common name for plants formerly included in the genus Pyrethrum. Pyrethrum is also the name of a natural insecticide made from the dried flower heads of Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium and Chrysanthemum coccineum. The insecticidal compounds present in these species are pyrethrins.</j.0:plantDescription>
        <j.0:plantDiseases>Chrysanthemum falls victim to several diseases and parasites. These are nonetheless avoidable, especially if you take care to avoid wetting the foliage. Space each plant sufficiently so that they don’t touch each other.
Powdery mildew – a whitish growth covers leaves and stems.
Rust – blisters appear on the underside of leaves.
Aphids – leaves curl up and fall off.</j.0:plantDiseases>

Remove wilted flowers as they appear, since this increases production of new flowers. Water when the soil is dry, especially if using a pot, because chrysanthemum call for moist soil to grow properly.You should endeavor not to wet the leaves.

The plant is native to Mexico, Central America, West Indies, and northern South America. It has been cultivated widely as both an ornamental and for use in traditional medicine. It is now naturalized throughout the tropics including Australasia, Indochina, and India. Rauvolfia tetraphylla fruits are called devil-peppers and hold an important position in the Indian traditional system of medicine. The plant has various significances and it is widely used by South Indian tribes. Asima Chatterjee initiated chemical investigation of alkaloids in Rauvolfia tetraphylla then known as Rauwolfia canescens. Indole alkaloids including serpentine, reserpine, serpentinine, and other Rauwolfia alkaloids were identified in phytochemical study.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Reicheocactus, is a monotypic genus of cactus in the family Cactaceae, native to north western Argentina. It has only one known species; Reicheocactus famatimensis (Speg.) Schlumpb. It is usually solitary or slowly clumping and slow growing. The stems are small flattened-roundish to cylindrical with very short spidery-pectinate spines and egg-yellow flowers. The species grows at elevations of 1,000 to 3,000 m (3,300 to 9,800 ft) metres above sea level.It is found in high altitude grasslands on rocky soils. The species is not common or abundant, however it is difficult to see because of its small size. The major threat for the species is over collection (by plant collectors). The potential development of mining in its natural habitat could affect the populations of the species in the near future. The genus Reicheocactus was published in Cactaceae (Berlin) 1941(2) on page 76 (published in 1942), and the species was published in Cactaceae Syst. Init. vol.28 on page 30 in 2012. It was once thought to be a synonym of Rebutia,and commonly found in cactus nurseries as Lobivia famatimensis. The genus name of Reicheocactus is in honour of Karl Friedrich Reiche (1860-1929), who was a German botanist who worked as a university professor in Chile and Mexico. The Latin specific epithet of famatimensis is derived from Sierra de Famatina, a mountain range and massif in the Andes of the Argentine province of La Rioja.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Reynoutria japonica, synonyms Fallopia japonica and Polygonum cuspidatum, is a species of herbaceous perennial plant in the knotweed and buckwheat family Polygonaceae. Common names include Japanese knotweed and Asian knotweed. It is native to East Asia in Japan, China and Korea. In North America and Europe, the species has successfully established itself in numerous habitats, and is classified as a pest and invasive species in several countries. Japanese knotweed has hollow stems with distinct raised nodes that give it the appearance of bamboo, though it is not related. While stems may reach a maximum height of 3–4 m (10–13 ft) each growing season, it is typical to see much smaller plants in places where they sprout through cracks in the pavement or are repeatedly cut down. The leaves are broad oval with a truncated base, 7–14 cm (3–5+1⁄2 in) long and 5–12 cm (2–4+1⁄2 in) broad, with an entire margin. The flowers are small, cream or white, produced in erect racemes 6–15 cm (2+1⁄2–6 in) long in late summer and early autumn. Related species include giant knotweed (Reynoutria sachalinensis, syns. Fallopia sachalinensis, Polygonum sachalinense) and Russian vine (Fallopia baldschuanica, syn. Polygonum baldschuanicum).</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>The Rhipsalideae are a small tribe of cacti, comprising four genera (and around 60 species). They grow on trees (epiphytes) or on rocks (lithophytes), where they either hang down or form creeping or upright shrubs. Their flowers open in the day and remain open at night; they may be either radially symmetrical (regular) or bilaterally symmetrical (zygomorphic). The fruits are berry-like, fleshy with smallish seeds. They are found mainly in the east of South America, with a centre of diversity in Bolivia, but some species occur in Central America and North America; one species, Rhipsalis baccifera, also occurs in the Old World.</j.0:plantDescription>
        <j.0:plantDiseases>Although most problems associated with cacti and succulents grown as houseplants are bacterial or fungal diseases caused by overwatering, they do get the occasional insect pest like mealy bugs, and root mealybugs.

        <j.0:plantDescription>Rhus glabra, the smooth sumac, (also known as white sumac, upland sumac, or scarlet sumac) is a species of sumac in the family Anacardiaceae, native to North America, from southern Quebec west to southern British Columbia in Canada, and south to northern Florida and Arizona in the United States and Tamaulipas in northeastern Mexico. One of the easiest shrubs to identify throughout the year (unless mistaken for poison sumac, in the absence of mature fruit), smooth sumac has a spreading, open habit, growing up to 3 m (9.8 ft) tall, rarely to 5 m (16 ft). The leaves are alternate, 30–50 cm (12–20 in) long, compound with 11–31 oppositely paired leaflets, each leaflet 5–11 cm (2–4+1⁄4 in) long, with a serrated margin. The leaves turn scarlet in the fall. The flowers are tiny, green, produced in dense erect panicles 10–25 cm (4–10 in) tall, in the spring, later followed by large panicles of edible crimson berries that remain throughout the winter. The buds are small, covered with brown hair and borne on fat, hairless twigs. The bark on older wood is smooth and grey to brown. In late summer it sometimes forms galls on the underside of leaves, caused by the parasitic sumac leaf gall aphid, Melaphis rhois. The galls are not harmful to the tree.</j.0:plantDescription>

Sources differ on whether it can be found in northern Africa and Anatolia. A dog rose, it is in the subgenus Rosa, section Caninae, and subsection Rubigineae. It is a close relative of, and very similar to the sweet briar, Rosa rubiginosa, but with smaller leaves, white to blush petals, and very little odor from either the flowers or the leaves. Although it may be cultivated, most gardeners prefer the sweet briar for its scented foliage and pink flowers.

* Rosa arkansana var. arkansana 
* Rosa arkansana var. suffulta (Greene) Cockerell The name Rosa arkansana comes from the Arkansas River in Colorado. The species&apos; wide distribution and consequent genetic drift has led to an extensive synonymy. It is a perennial subshrub and its native habitats include prairies, roadsides, and ditches.

        <j.0:plantDescription>Rosa brunonii is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is commonly known as Himalayan musk rose. It is a deciduous or semi-evergreen climber most commonly seen along the foothills of the Himalayas and grows at heights of 1200–2400 m. Come May, all the musk rose bushes burst into bloom, clothing trees, running wild over hedges and tumbling precariously over cliffs and boulders. The air is heady with their scent and honeybees and nectar-loving insects have a field day. The five-petalled flowers are white and about 3–4 cm across, filled with a mass of yellow stamens. The stems are prickly and the leaves are finely-toothed ovals with pointed tips. Rosa moschata found in the western Himalayas is very similar, the main difference being that its branches are smooth and the leaf stalks are without prickles. Several other varieties of wild white roses grow in the hills. Wild, pink roses or Rosa macrophylla are also common and can be seen growing side by side with the white ones. When the wild rose withers away, its place is taken by a red rounded fruit known as a rose-hip. In Hindi, the musk rose is known as Kuji, Kunja or Karer. Sometimes the wood is used to make walking sticks. An attar is extracted from the flowers. A soothing cough syrup is made out of the hips; these have a high vitamin C content. A kind of a marmalade can also be made of the hips by boiling them and passing the pulp through a sieve; to each 1/2 kg of pulp add an equal amount of sugar and boil until it jells.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Rosa cymosa is a species of climbing rose native to China, where it grows from the east coast in Fujian to western Sichuan at up to 1300 m, in warm areas in scrub and gorges, and in bamboo plantations. It is sometimes called the elderflower rose as its flower formation resembles elderberry (Sambucus) flowers. Rosa cymosa has long smooth or hairy stems to 5 m, with a few, hooked thorns. Shoots and leaves are bright red when young. The leaflets are narrowly lanceolate, rounded at the base, and acuminate with a slender, curved point. Stipules are narrow and not attached to the stalk, or soon falling. The pedicels are slender. Flowers small and numerous, in a compound umbel or corymb, creamy-white, 1–1.5 cm across.

        <j.0:plantDescription>Rosa fedtschenkoana is a species in the plant genus Rosa in the family Rosaceae. Some authorities consider it a synonym of Rosa webbiana. It is native to the foothills of the Ala Tau, Tian Shan and Pamir-Alai mountain ranges in central Asia and northwest China. It is named after Olga Fédchenko, a Russian botanist. It is deciduous, forming a bushy and suckering shrub up to 2.5 metres high and as much across. The branches are covered in many prickles, many of which are fine and straight, but some are thicker and slightly hooked. The pinnate leaves are pale greyish green in colour and have usually between 7 and 9 leaflets. The flowers are white, up to 5 cm across, and are borne singly or in small clusters at the tips of the branches throughout the summer months. The flowers&apos; scent has been described as being &quot;like &apos;Hovis&apos; [brown] bread with a little blackberry jam&quot;. The flowers are followed by small, pear-shaped, bristly orange-red fruits. Recent DNA research has discovered that R. fedtschenkoana is one of the parents of the damask group of garden roses (the other species involved being R. moschata and R. gallica). This accounts for the remontant (repeat-flowering) nature of some damasks (the autumn damasks), as R. fedtschenkoana is one of the few remontant wild roses.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Rosa gigantea is a species of rose native to northeast India, northern Myanmar and southwest China (Yunnan) in the foothills of the Himalaya at 1000–1500 m altitude. It is sometimes considered to be a variety of Rosa odorata, as R. odorata var. gigantea. As its name suggests, it is the largest species of rose, climbing 20 m or more into the crowns of other trees by means of its stout, hooked thorns, and with a trunk up to 50 cm diameter. The leaves are semi-evergreen, 15–25 cm long, pinnate, with usually 7 leaflets, each leaflet 4–8 cm long. The flowers are white, creamy or yellow, the largest of any wild rose, 10–14 cm diameter. The hips are yellow or orange, 2.5–3.5 cm diameter, hard, and often lasting through the winter into the following spring, often still present at the same time as the next years&apos; flowers. Another rose, described from Manipur in 1888 as R. macrocarpa and R. xanthocarpa by Sir George Watt, an authority on Indian roses, is now generally considered to be the same species as R. gigantea. The distinct characteristics claimed for R. macrocarpa (deeper yellow flowers, larger foliage with 4 to 7 leaflets and large yellow fruits) are not consistent. After gene sequencing was carried out in 2018, it was found that is closely related to Rosa odorata var. gigantea.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Rosa nitida, also known as the shining rose due to its glossy leaves (nitidus is Latin for &apos;shining&apos;), is a perennial species in the plant genus Rosa in the plant family Rosaceae. It is native to northeastern North America, from Connecticut north to Newfoundland and Quebec. It forms a low, suckering, deciduous shrub, growing up to a metre in height, although often less. Its stems are thin and covered in fine bristles. Its pinnate leaves have 7 to 9 shining leaflets which turn bright red, yellow and purple in the fall. Its small pink flowers appear in summer and are subtly but sweetly scented, smelling like Convallaria (&quot;Lily-of-the-Valley&quot;). They are followed by small, round, red hips. Rosa nitida is very hardy, tolerating temperatures as low as −40 °C (−40 °F), and will grow in a wide variety of soil conditions, including soils which are poor, acidic and waterlogged. In the wild it grows in bogs and by the edges of ponds. In the garden it is admired for its good leaf coloration in the fall.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Rosa omeiensis is a species of Rosa native to central and southwestern China in the provinces of Gansu, Guizhou, Hubei, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Xizang, and Yunnan; it grows in mountains at altitudes of 700 to 4,400 m. It is a shrub which grows 4 m tall, and is often very spiny. The leaves are deciduous, 3–6 cm long, with 5–13 leaflets with a serrated margin. The flowers are 2.5–3.5 cm diameter, white, with (unusually for a rose) only four petals. The hips are red to orange-yellow, 8–15 mm diameter, with persistent sepals, and often bristly. There are four formae: 
* Rosa omeiensis f. omeiensis. 
* Rosa omeiensis f. glandulosa T.T.Yü &amp; T.C.Ku. 
* Rosa omeiensis f. paucijuga T.T.Yü &amp; T.C.Ku. 
* Rosa omeiensis f. pteracantha Rehder &amp; E.H.Wilson. It is sometimes treated as a subspecies of the closely related species Rosa sericea.</j.0:plantDescription>

It is native to deserts and steppes from Iran and Afghanistan in the south, through Central Asia, to western Siberia in the north. Its distinctive characteristics include a simple leaf without stipules (most rose leaves are pinnate with 3 to 7 leaflets, and have stipules), and a distinctive flower with a darker coloured central zone. In its natural habitat it is a deep-rooted weed that suckers – growing in Iranian fields for example, where it is collected for fuel once the grain crop has been harvested – but it is difficult to grow in gardens and rarely cultivated. is sometimes considered to be variety of this species, as R. persica var. berberifolia.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Rosa stellata is a species of rose known by the common names desert rose, gooseberry rose, and star rose. In Texas this type of rose grows on dry rocky places to 6,500 feet (2,000 m), such as the Trans-Pecos. It occurs in the mountain canyons of Arizona and New Mexico. It also grows in dry, rocky places. It has trifoliate leaves, deep rose purple blossoms and yellowish white prickles on the petioles and stems. It is a perennial shrub with velvety, deciduous leaves. Some horticulturists consider it to be a browse plant. Rosa stellata can be used as a groundcover or small shrub and grows best when partially exposed to sunlight. The purple flowers bloom in the summer and it typically grows to be between 16 and 24 inches tall. It attracts native bees and bumble bees. Native bees also use the plant for nesting materials.

        <j.0:plantDescription>Rosa virginiana, commonly known as the Virginia rose, common wild rose or prairie rose, is a woody perennial in the rose family native to eastern North America, where it is the most common wild rose. It is deciduous, forming a suckering shrub up to 2 metres in height, though often less. The stems are covered in numerous hooked prickles. The leaves are pinnate, usually with between 7 and 9 glossy leaflets. The pink flowers are borne singly or in small clusters and appear over a long period in midsummer. The fruits are small, round and bright red, rich in vitamin C and edible, being both used to make jams and tea. It grows in clearings, thickets, and shores. The plant attracts birds, bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds. Charles and Bridget Quest-Ritson describe R. virginiana as &quot;the best all-rounder among the wild roses&quot;, and draw attention to its leaf coloration in the fall: &quot;the whole plant turns yellow, orange, scarlet, crimson and brown for weeks on end&quot;.

The branches are covered in many straight prickles. The pinnate leaves typically have 7 to 9 small bluish-green leaflets which emit a pleasant fragrance when bruised. It was introduced to western cultivation by Ernest Wilson in 1904 and was named after the collector and horticulturist Ellen Willmott. The flowers are small (25–40 millimetres or 1.0–1.6 inches), lilac-pink, and are borne on short laterals all along the length of the branches in late spring/early summer. The hips are small, becoming orange-red and losing their tips when ripe. Charles &amp; Bridget Quest-Ritson describe Rosa willmottiae as &quot;one of the few wild roses that merits a place in a mixed border or even as a specimen shrub&quot; and that when in flower it is &quot;the embodiment of beauty&quot;.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>A rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa, in the family Rosaceae, or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa. Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant. Roses have acquired cultural significance in many societies. Rose plants range in size from compact, miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.</j.0:plantDescription>

Its common names include French sorrel, buckler sorrel, shield-leaf sorrel, and sometimes the culinary name &quot;green-sauce&quot;. As a culinary herb, it is used in salads, soups, and sauces (especially for fish). French sorrel tastes tart from its oxalic acid content, with a hint of lemon. Later in the season, it can be bitter. French sorrel is hardy in most regions, tolerating frost, full sun and short dry spells. It grows quickly to a clump up to 1 m (3.3 ft) in diameter, with long leaves up to 10 cm (4 in) wide. It is sometimes preferred for culinary uses to Rumex acetosa, garden sorrel.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Salvia caymanensis, the Cayman sage, is a short-lived perennial plant in the genus Salvia that is endemic to Grand Cayman in the Cayman Islands. It was thought to be extinct for nearly 40 years until it was rediscovered in 2007. After the damage caused by Hurricane Ivan in 2004, conservationists thought that conditions might be ideal for the reappearance of Salvia caymanensis if there was still viable seeds in the wild. A wanted poster, offering a 1000 CI$ reward, led to the discovery of the first plants seen since 1967.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Salvia yangii, previously known as Perovskia atriplicifolia (/pəˈrɒvskiə ætrɪplɪsɪˈfoʊliə/), and commonly called Russian sage, is a flowering herbaceous perennial plant and subshrub. Although not previously a member of Salvia, the genus widely known as sage, since 2017 it has been included within them. It has an upright habit, typically reaching 0.5–1.2 metres (1+1⁄2–4 feet) tall, with square stems and gray-green leaves that yield a distinctive odor when crushed. It is best known for its flowers. Its flowering season extends from mid-summer to late October, with blue to violet blossoms arranged into showy, branched panicles. It is native to the steppes and hills of southwestern and central Asia. Successful over a wide range of climate and soil conditions, it has since become popular and widely planted. Several cultivars have been developed, differing primarily in leaf shape and overall height; &apos;Blue Spire&apos; is the most common. This variation has been widely used in gardens and landscaping. S. yangii was the Perennial Plant Association&apos;s 1995 Plant of the Year, and the &apos;Blue Spire&apos; cultivar received the Award of Garden Merit from the Royal Horticultural Society. The species has a long history of use in traditional medicine in its native range, where it is employed as a treatment for a variety of ailments. This has led to the investigation of its phytochemistry. Its flowers can be eaten in salads or crushed for dyemaking, and the plant has been considered for potential use in the phytoremediation of contaminated soil.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Senecio angulatus, also known as creeping groundsel and Cape ivy,is a succulent flowering plant in the family Asteraceae that is native to South Africa. Cape ivy is a scrambling and a twining herb that can become an aggressive weed once established, making it an invasive species. It has been naturalised in the Mediterranean Basin, where it is grown as an ornamental plant for its satiny foliage and sweet-scented flowers. Other names include climbing groundsel, Algerian senecio, and scrambling groundsel. Cape ivy can be distinguished vegetatively from Delairea odorata (German ivy) by the lack of lobes at the leaf stalk base, the fleshy leaf surface, the outwardly curved leaf teeth, stiff stems, a more rambling habit, and the ray florets with petal-like ligules. In Australia, Senecio tamoides (Canary creeper) may usually be misapplied and is considered to be Senecio angulatus.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Senna obtusifolia, known by the common names Chinese senna, American sicklepod, sicklepod, etc., is a plant in the genus Senna, sometimes separated in the monotypic genus Diallobus. It grows wild in North, Central, and South America, Asia, Africa, and Oceania, and is considered a particularly serious weed in many places. It has a long-standing history of confusion with Senna tora and that taxon in many sources actually refers to the present species. In the traditional medicine of Eastern Asia, the seeds are called jué míng zǐ in Chinese (simplified: 决明子; traditional: 決明子), gyeolmyeongja in Korean, and ketsumeishi in Japanese. The green leaves of the plant are fermented to produce a high-protein food product called &quot;kawal&quot; which is eaten by many people in Sudan as a meat substitute. Its leaves, seeds, and root are also used in folk medicine, primarily in Asia. It is believed to possess a laxative effect, as well as to be beneficial for the eyes. As a folk remedy, the seeds are often roasted, then boiled in water to produce a tea. The plant&apos;s seeds are a commercial source of cassia gum, a food additive usually used as a thickener and named for the Chinese Senna&apos;s former placement in the genus Cassia. Roasted and ground, the seeds have also been used as a substitute for coffee. In vitro cultures of S. obtusifolia such as hairy roots may be a source of valuable secondary metabolites with medical applications.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>A spruce is a tree of the genus Picea (/paɪˈsiː.ə/), a genus of about 35 species of coniferous evergreen trees in the family Pinaceae, found in the northern temperate and boreal (taiga) regions of the Earth. Picea is the sole genus in the subfamily Piceoideae. Spruces are large trees, from about 20 to 60 m (about 60–200 ft) tall when mature, and have whorled branches and conical form. They can be distinguished from other members of the pine family by their needles (leaves), which are four-sided and attached singly to small persistent peg-like structures (pulvini or sterigmata) on the branches, and by their cones (without any protruding bracts), which hang downwards after they are pollinated. The needles are shed when 4–10 years old, leaving the branches rough with the retained pegs. In other similar genera, the branches are fairly smooth. Spruce are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (moth and butterfly) species, such as the eastern spruce budworm. They are also used by the larvae of gall adelgids (Adelges species). In the mountains of western Sweden, scientists have found a Norway spruce, nicknamed Old Tjikko, which by reproducing through layering, has reached an age of 9,550 years and is claimed to be the world&apos;s oldest known living tree.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Stevia (/ˈstiːviə, ˈstɛviə/) is a natural sweetener and sugar substitute derived from the leaves of the plant species Stevia rebaudiana, native to Paraguay and Brazil. The active compounds are steviol glycosides (mainly stevioside and rebaudioside), which have about 50 to 300 times the sweetness of sugar, are heat-stable, pH-stable, and not fermentable. The human body does not metabolize the glycosides in stevia, so it contains zero calories as a non-nutritive sweetener. Stevia&apos;s taste has a slower onset and longer duration than that of sugar, and at high concentrations some of its extracts may have an aftertaste described as licorice-like or bitter. Stevia is used in sugar- and calorie-reduced food and beverage products as an alternative for variants with sugar. The legal status of stevia as a food additive or dietary supplement varies from country to country. In the United States, high-purity stevia glycoside extracts have been generally recognized as safe (GRAS) since 2008, and are allowed in food products, but stevia leaf and crude extracts do not have GRAS or Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for use in food. The European Union approved Stevia additives in 2011, while in Japan, stevia has been widely used as a sweetener for decades. The plant Stevia rebaudiana has been used for more than 1,500 years by the Guaraní peoples of South America, who called it ka&apos;a he&apos;ê (&quot;sweet herb&quot;). The leaves have been used traditionally for hundreds of years in both Paraguay and Brazil to sweeten local teas and medicines, and as a &quot;sweet treat&quot;. The genus was named for the Spanish botanist and physician Pedro Jaime Esteve (Petrus Jacobus Stevus, 1500–1556) a professor of botany at the University of Valencia. In 1899, Swiss botanist Moisés Santiago Bertoni, while conducting research in eastern Paraguay, first described the plant and the sweet taste in detail. Only limited research was conducted on the topic until, in 1931, two French chemists isolated the glycosides that give stevia its sweet taste.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Stevia rebaudiana is a plant species in the genus Stevia of the family Asteraceae. It is commonly known as candyleaf, sweetleaf or sugarleaf. It is a small seasonal plant which grows to a height of 30–60 centimetres (1–2 feet). It has elongated leaves that grow along the stems and are lined up against each other. The flowers are typically trimmed to improve the taste of the leaves. Stevia is a tender perennial native to parts of Brazil and Paraguay having humid, wet environments. Stevia is widely grown for its leaves, from which extracts can be manufactured as sweetener products known generically as stevia and sold under various trade names. The chemical compounds that produce its sweetness are various steviol glycosides (mainly stevioside and rebaudioside), which have 200–300 times the sweetness of sugar. Stevia leaves contain 9.1% stevioside and 3.8% rebaudioside A.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Strombocactus disciformis is a rare species of cacti and the only species of the genus Strombocactus. The plant originates from Central and Northeast Mexico.</j.0:plantDescription>
        <j.0:plantDiseases>Although most problems associated with cacti and succulents grown as houseplants are bacterial or fungal diseases caused by overwatering, they do get the occasional insect pest like mealy bugs, and root mealybugs.
Cochinealis usually found on cactus of the Opuntia genera like  Angel Wing or  Rufida Minima Cinnamon cactus and can be treated using only a spray of water.
Corking is an entirely natural occurrence with cactus and will not cause any harm. This is simply an indication that your plant has lived and grown large enough to require a little extra care.</j.0:plantDiseases>

        <j.0:plantMaintenance>Just like with succulents, cacti need regular watering to help them grow during their active season. As a general rule of thumb, it is best to provide cacti with at least 4 to 6 hours of bright sunlight per day to encourage flowering. Your cactus&apos; soil must be well-draining. Cactus should be repotted at least once a year to give them fresh soil and to check their roots to ensure that they’re healthy. To encourage new growth and flowering, regularly feed your cactus with a low-nitrogen or cactus blend fertilizer every few weeks throughout Spring and Summer, when it is actively growing.</j.0:plantMaintenance>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Tilia is a genus of about 30 species of trees or bushes, native throughout most of the temperate Northern Hemisphere. The tree is known as linden for the European species, and basswood for North American species. In Britain and Ireland they are commonly called lime trees, although they are not related to the citrus lime. The genus occurs in Europe and eastern North America, but the greatest species diversity is found in Asia. Under the Cronquist classification system, this genus was placed in the family Tiliaceae, but genetic research summarised by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group has resulted in the incorporation of this genus, and of most of the previous family, into the Malvaceae. Tilia species are mostly large, deciduous trees, reaching typically 20 to 40 m (65 to 130 ft) tall, with oblique-cordate (heart-shaped) leaves 6 to 20 cm (2+1⁄4 to 7+3⁄4 in) across. As with elms, the exact number of species is uncertain, as many of the species can hybridise readily, both in the wild and in cultivation. They are hermaphroditic, having perfect flowers with both male and female parts, pollinated by insects. Tilia is the only known ectomycorrhizal genus in the family Malvaceae. Studies of ectomycorrhizal relations of Tilia species indicate a wide range of fungal symbionts and a preference toward Ascomycota fungal partners.</j.0:plantDescription>
        <j.0:plantDiseases>Anthracnose fungus disease occurs in the late spring and early summer, especially if spring is cool and wet. Anthracnose is most prominent on the lower half of the tree and shows spots or lesions that range from tan to reddish brown or black. Root feeding is strongly recommended to help the tree combat the disease.
Dutch Elm disease is the most destructive shade tree disease. Dutch elm disease causes serious economic and aesthetic losses in cities and towns where the elms are the principal shade tree.

The common names largeleaf linden and large-leaved linden are in standard use throughout the English-speaking world except in the British Isles, where it is known as large-leaved lime. The name &quot;lime&quot;, possibly a corruption of &quot;line&quot; originally from &quot;lind&quot;, has been in use for centuries and also attaches to other species of Tilia. It is not, however, closely related to the lime fruit tree, a species of citrus.

        <j.0:plantDescription>Tradescantia zebrina, formerly known as Zebrina pendula, is a species of creeping plant in the Tradescantia genus. Common names include silver inch plant and wandering Jew. The latter name (also sometimes used for the related species T. fluminensis) is controversial, and some now use the alternative wandering dude. The plant is popular in cultivation due to its fast growth and attractive foliage. It is used as a groundcover in warm winter climates, and as a houseplant elsewhere.</j.0:plantDescription>

It is native to Europe, including the British Isles, and central Asia and is one of the most widely cultivated types of clover. It has been widely introduced worldwide as a forage crop, and is now also common in most grassy areas (lawns and gardens) of North America, Australia and New Zealand. The species includes varieties often classed as small, intermediate and large, according to height, which reflects petiole length. The term &apos;white clover&apos; is applied to the species in general, &apos;Dutch clover&apos; is often applied to intermediate varieties (but sometimes to smaller varieties), and &apos;ladino clover&apos; is applied to large varieties.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Tulip breaking virus is one of five plant viruses of the family Potyviridae that cause color-breaking of tulip flowers. These viruses infect plants in only two genera of the family Liliaceae: tulips (Tulipa) and lilies (Lilium). Also known as the tulip break virus, lily streak virus, lily mosaic virus, or simply TBV, Tulip breaking virus is most famous for its dramatic effects on the color of the tulip perianth, an effect highly sought after during the 17th-century Dutch &quot;tulip mania&quot;. Tulip breaking virus is a potyvirus. A distant serological relationship between Tulip breaking virus and tobacco etch virus was discovered in 1971. Tulip breaking virus (TBV), tulip top-breaking virus (TTBV), tulip bandbreaking virus (TBBV), Rembrandt tulip-breaking virus (ReTBV), and lily mottle virus (LMoV) have all been identified as potyviruses by serology and potyvirus-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition, sequence analysis of amplified DNA fragments has classified them all as distinct viruses or strains; recently TTBV has been found to be strain-related to turnip mosaic virus.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Tulipa regelii, the plicate tulip or Regel&apos;s tulip, is a species of tulip native to southeast Kazakhstan. Rare, growing only in certain dry, rocky areas in the Chu-Ili Range, a northern subrange of the Tian Shan range, it is a very distinctive species with bizarre plicate leaves, usually only one, occasionally two. The species was first formally named by Russian botanist and geographer . It flowers in April.

        <j.0:plantDescription>Tulipa sprengeri, or Sprenger&apos;s tulip, is a wild tulip from the Pontic coast of Turkey. It is quite rare and possibly extinct in the wild, but widely cultivated as an ornamental. Daniel Hall put it into the Kolpakowskiana group, later in the &quot;solitary species&quot;. Wessel Marais placed it in section Tulipa because of its naked filament. Genetically, it seems to belong to the section Eriostemones, even if it does not have a hairy filament, normally seen as a defining characteristic, whereas glabrous filaments are typical of the Tulipa-group. It is diploid. The locus typicus is Amasya.</j.0:plantDescription>

Deadhead tulips after flowering by removing spent flowers to encourage bulb energy to go into bulb development rather than seed production.
Overcrowded bulbs may produce fewer blooms. Lift and divide tulip bulbs every 3-4 years.</j.0:plantMaintenance>

It just contains one species, Vatricania guentheri (Kupper) Backeb.Greenm. ex Gleason It has the common name of Red Tail Cactus. Its native range is Bolivia. It is found in dry forest vegetation or covering hillsides, at altitudes of 800–1,300 metres (2,600–4,300 ft) metres above sea level.</j.0:plantDescription>
        <j.0:plantDiseases>Although most problems associated with cacti and succulents grown as houseplants are bacterial or fungal diseases caused by overwatering, they do get the occasional insect pest like mealy bugs, and root mealybugs.

        <j.0:plantMaintenance>Just like with succulents, cacti need regular watering to help them grow during their active season. As a general rule of thumb, it is best to provide cacti with at least 4 to 6 hours of bright sunlight per day to encourage flowering. Your cactus&apos; soil must be well-draining. Cactus should be repotted at least once a year to give them fresh soil and to check their roots to ensure that they’re healthy. To encourage new growth and flowering, regularly feed your cactus with a low-nitrogen or cactus blend fertilizer every few weeks throughout Spring and Summer, when it is actively growing.</j.0:plantMaintenance>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Verbascum thapsus, the great mullein, greater mullein or common mullein is a species of mullein native to Europe, northern Africa, and Asia, and introduced in the Americas and Australia. It is a hairy biennial plant that can grow to 2 m tall or more. Its small, yellow flowers are densely grouped on a tall stem, which grows from a large rosette of leaves. It grows in a wide variety of habitats, but prefers well-lit, disturbed soils, where it can appear soon after the ground receives light, from long-lived seeds that persist in the soil seed bank. It is a common weedy plant that spreads by prolifically producing seeds, and has become invasive in temperate world regions. It is a minor problem for most agricultural crops, since it is not a competitive species, being intolerant of shade from other plants and unable to survive tilling. It also hosts many insects, some of which can be harmful to other plants. Although individuals are easy to remove by hand, populations are difficult to eliminate permanently. Although commonly used in traditional medicine, no approved drugs are made from this plant. It has been used to make dyes and torches.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Waldsteinia ternata, commonly referred to as barren strawberry, is an herbaceous perennial plant. It has a disjunct distribution, being native to Eastern Europe and Eastern Asia, namely the Changbai Mountains of China, Sakhalin and Siberia in Russia, and Japan. Both the leaves and the flowers of W. ternara are reminiscent of strawberry. The leaves are trifoliate (hence the specific epithet), arranged in rosettes, glossy, and evergreen in climates with mild winters. The yellow, five-petaled flowers appear in late spring or early summer. The fruit is an inedible berry. The plant usually grows 4 inches (10 cm) to 6 inches (15 cm) tall and forms a thick foliage carpet by spreading via stolons and rhizomes. The spread is slow and thus not seen as aggressive. W. ternata has been cultivated since at least 1803. The cultivated plants are, for the most part, based on W. ternata subsp. trifolia. Undemanding of soil conditions, W. ternata is used in landscape and garden design as a groundcover or as an edger for the herbaceous border. As it can grow in either sun or dappled shade, it is considered appropriate for shade gardens. Neither pests nor diseases pose significant problems. The &apos;Kronstadt&apos; cultivar has enlarged flowers, while &apos;Variegata&apos; has variegated leaves.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Yavia cryptocarpa is a species of cactus (family Cactaceae) and the only species of the newly discovered genus Yavia. The genus is named after Argentina&apos;s department Yavi, Jujuy Province, where the plant is endemic to sparsely vegetated rocky slopes. The plant is also sometimes put in the tribe Trichocereeae.The specific epithet cryptocarpa refers to the plant being a cryptocarp. This means that the fruits are formed inside the plant&apos;s body, thus being only visible when the plant shrinks in the drought period.</j.0:plantDescription>
        <j.0:plantDiseases>Although most problems associated with cacti and succulents grown as houseplants are bacterial or fungal diseases caused by overwatering, they do get the occasional insect pest like mealy bugs, and root mealybugs.

        <j.0:plantMaintenance>Just like with succulents, cacti need regular watering to help them grow during their active season. As a general rule of thumb, it is best to provide cacti with at least 4 to 6 hours of bright sunlight per day to encourage flowering. Your cactus&apos; soil must be well-draining. Cactus should be repotted at least once a year to give them fresh soil and to check their roots to ensure that they’re healthy. To encourage new growth and flowering, regularly feed your cactus with a low-nitrogen or cactus blend fertilizer every few weeks throughout Spring and Summer, when it is actively growing.</j.0:plantMaintenance>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Cannabis, also known as marijuana among other names, is a psychoactive drug from the cannabis plant. Native to Central or South Asia, the cannabis plant has been used as a drug for both recreational and entheogenic purposes and in various traditional medicines for centuries. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychoactive component of cannabis, which is one of the 483 known compounds in the plant, including at least 65 other cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD). Cannabis can be used by smoking, vaporizing, within food, or as an extract. Cannabis has various mental and physical effects, which include euphoria, altered states of mind and sense of time, difficulty concentrating, impaired short-term memory, impaired body movement (balance and fine psychomotor control), relaxation, and an increase in appetite. Onset of effects is felt within minutes when smoked, but may take up to 90 minutes when eaten. The effects last for two to six hours, depending on the amount used. At high doses, mental effects can include anxiety, delusions (including ideas of reference), hallucinations, panic, paranoia, and psychosis. There is a strong relation between cannabis use and the risk of psychosis, though the direction of causality is debated. Physical effects include increased heart rate, difficulty breathing, nausea, and behavioral problems in children whose mothers used cannabis during pregnancy; short-term side effects may also include dry mouth and red eyes. Long-term adverse effects may include addiction, decreased mental ability in those who started regular use as adolescents, chronic coughing, susceptibility to respiratory infections, and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. Cannabis is mostly used recreationally or as a medicinal drug, although it may also be used for spiritual purposes. In 2013, between 128 and 232 million people used cannabis (2.7% to 4.9% of the global population between the ages of 15 and 65). It is the most commonly used largely-illegal drug in the world, with the highest use among adults in Zambia, the United States, Canada, and Nigeria, as of 2018. While cannabis plants have been grown since at least the 3rd millennium BCE, evidence suggests that it was being smoked for psychoactive effects at least 2,500 years ago in the Pamir Mountains, Asia. Since the 14th century, cannabis has been subject to legal restrictions. The possession, use, and cultivation of cannabis has been illegal in most countries since the 20th century. In 2013, Uruguay became the first country to legalize recreational use of cannabis. Other countries to do so are Canada, Georgia, Malta, Mexico, South Africa, and Thailand. In the U.S., the recreational use of cannabis is legalized in 21 states, two territories, and the District of Columbia, though the drug remains federally illegal. In Australia, is legalized only in the Australian Capital Territory.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Floribunda (Latin for &quot;many-flowering&quot;) is a modern group of garden roses that was developed by crossing hybrid teas with polyantha roses, the latter being derived from crosses between Rosa chinensis and Rosa multiflora (sometimes called R. polyantha). The idea was to create roses that bloomed with the polyantha profusion, but with hybrid tea floral beauty and colour range. The first polyantha/hybrid tea cross, &apos;Rødhætte&apos; (&apos;Red Riding Hood&apos;), was introduced by the Danish breeder in 1907. It possessed characteristics of both its parent classes, and was initially called a Hybrid Polyantha or Poulsen rose. Poulsen continued this line of work in subsequent years, introducing several Hybrid Polyanthas such as &apos;Else Poulsen&apos; in 1924. Other breeders also began introducing similar varieties, and in 1930 the name &quot;floribunda&quot; was coined by Dr. J.N. Nicolas, a rose hybridizer for Jackson &amp; Perkins in the US. This term has been used since then to describe cultivars which in their ancestry have crosses between hybrid teas and polyanthas. Typical floribundas feature stiff shrubs, smaller and bushier than the average hybrid tea but less dense and sprawling than the average polyantha. The flowers are often smaller than hybrid teas but are carried in large sprays, giving a better floral effect in the garden. Floribundas are found in all hybrid tea colours and with the classic hybrid tea-shaped blossom, sometimes differing from hybrid teas only in their cluster-flowering habit. Today they are still used in large bedding schemes in public parks and similar spaces.</j.0:plantDescription>

It originated as a hybrid produced in 1890 by the American horticulturist Luther Burbank from a number of daisies. First, he crossed Leucanthemum vulgare with Leucanthemum maximum; this double hybrid was itself crossed with . The resulting Leucanthemum triple hybrid was crossed with Nipponanthemum nipponicum, creating an intergeneric cross of species from three continents. It was named after Mount Shasta, because its petals were the color of the snow. Some members of the genus are considered noxious weeds, but the Shasta daisy remains a favorite garden plant. Many cultivars are suitable for cut flowers, such as &apos;Becky&apos;, &apos;Esther Read&apos;, &apos;Silberprinzesschen&apos; (Silver Princess), &apos;Snow Lady&apos;, &apos;Tinkerbell&apos;, &apos;Wirral Pride&apos;, &apos;Wirral Supreme&apos;.

        <j.0:plantDescription>Pando (Latin for &quot;I spread&quot;), also known as The Trembling Giant, is a clonal colony of an individual male quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) determined to be a single living organism by identical genetic markers and assumed to have one massive underground root system. The plant is located in the Fremont River Ranger District of the Fishlake National Forest at the western edge of the Colorado Plateau in south-central Utah, United States, around 1 mile (1.6 km) southwest of Fish Lake. Pando occupies 108 acres (43.6 ha) and is estimated to weigh collectively 6,000 tonnes (6,000,000 kg), making it the heaviest known organism. The root system of Pando is estimated to be up to several thousand years old, placing Pando among the oldest known living organisms. Pando&apos;s long-term survival is uncertain due to a combination of factors including drought, human development, grazing, and fire suppression. The Western Aspen Alliance is studying the tree in an effort to save it in collaboration with the United States Forest Service. In areas of Pando lacking adequate protective fencing, grazing animals have prevented Pando from developing enough young stems to fully replace existing older stems as they die. This decline in recruitment of young stems began in the 1980s and has been attributed primarily to mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), though Pando also undergoes restricted grazing by domestic cattle (Bos taurus) and is potentially browsed by elk (Cervus canadensis).</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Picea × lutzii is a hybrid spruce tree that is a natural cross between white spruce and Sitka spruce occurring where the ranges of the two species overlap in coastal south-central Alaska and coastal British Columbia. Its common name is Lutz spruce. Its morphology is intermediate between the two parent species, the maritime Sitka spruce and the white spruce of dryer climates further inland. In addition to the parent spruces it shares its ecosystem with Tsuga heterophylla and T. mertensiana. The tree was named for , a scientist who specialized in forest soils and worked briefly for the United States Forest Service in Alaska where he collected the material used to describe the hybrid. A Lutz spruce from Alaska&apos;s Chugach National Forest was selected in 2015 for the Capitol Christmas Tree. This is the first Capitol Tree that has come from the state of Alaska. Lutz&apos;s spruce grows as tall as 30 meters in height, and it is a generally symmetrical tree with open and downward bowing branches. While its needles are sharp like the Sitka spruce, they are not as &quot;stiff&quot; and, therefore, less &quot;prickly.&quot; The seed cones closely resemble those of the Sitka spruce but are smaller and with the rounded tops of white spruce cones. Between 1987 and 2000 the largest known epidemic of spruce bark beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) caused the death of 90% of white, Sitka, and hybrid Lutz spruce, almost all of the mature spruce trees, in a 3.2 million acre forest in the Kenai Peninsula and Copper River. The spruce bark beetle is a part of the native ecosystem, mainly hosted by the white spruce of the dryer interior, in south-central Alaska where the tree loss occurred in apparently healthy old growth forest. One theory about the decimation of trees is that warmer spring and summer temperatures have allowed the beetles an annual reproductive cycle, shortened from every two to three years, while warmer winter temperatures have increased the number of beetles that live through winter to reproduce in spring. In addition to increased temperatures, increased aridity in the region has created dryer forests lowering the production of sap, a barrier defense against insect and fungal pests, in the spruces. Lutz spruces, like its primary host, the white spruce, are more susceptible than Sitka spruce and black spruce to bark beetle damage and suffer a higher mortality rate when infected.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Rosa × kordesii, or Rosa kordesii, is a red type of rose that arose naturally from hybridization followed by chromosome doubling. A hybrid between R. rugosa and R. lucieae was created called Rosa &apos;Max Graf&apos;, but it was diploid and nearly sterile, producing flowers but no fruit. This rose produced a few viable seeds as a result of self-pollination, and the seedlings that resulted were tetraploid instead of diploid, i.e., the chromosomes of both pollen and egg cells had been naturally duplicated. The tetraploid seedlings are amphidiploids. A selection with double deep pink flowers and repeat bloom, also called &apos;K01 AgCan&apos; was released by W. Kordes&apos; Söhne in 1951. These tetraploid roses interbreed readily with one another, but not with their diploid ancestors. Under the biological species concept, a new species name Rosa × kordesii was created for the tetraploid hybrid roses and their descendants. Amphidiploid roses can also be created deliberately from diploid-diploid hybrids by using colchicine spray on the growing tips of the plants. That strategy gives few successes, however, because the plant tissue has various chromosome numbers in different cells. Amphidiploid roses including Rosa × kordesii have been used to some degree in breeding programs in combination with naturally occurring tetraploid roses.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantMaintenance>Most herbs prefer full sunlight. Ensure your herbs receive at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day. Place potted herbs near south or west-facing windows indoors.
Use well-draining, nutrient-rich soil with good aeration. Amend the soil with organic matter like compost for improved fertility.
Water herbs consistently, keeping the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Allow the soil to dry out slightly between waterings to prevent root rot.
If growing herbs in containers, choose appropriately sized pots with drainage holes to prevent waterlogging.</j.0:plantMaintenance>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Tilia × europaea, generally known as the European lime, common lime (British Isles) or common linden, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Tilia cordata (small-leaved lime) and Tilia platyphyllos (large-leaved lime). It occurs in the wild in Europe at scattered localities wherever the two parent species are both native. It is not closely related to the lime fruit tree, a species of citrus.</j.0:plantDescription>
        <j.0:plantDiseases>Anthracnose fungus disease occurs in the late spring and early summer, especially if spring is cool and wet. Anthracnose is most prominent on the lower half of the tree and shows spots or lesions that range from tan to reddish brown or black. Root feeding is strongly recommended to help the tree combat the disease.
Dutch Elm disease is the most destructive shade tree disease. Dutch elm disease causes serious economic and aesthetic losses in cities and towns where the elms are the principal shade tree.

        <j.0:plantMaintenance>Schedule a cleanup for dead, diseased and cluttered branches. It’s easy to spot cluttered branches. They’ll grow at odd angles, grow inward toward the tree’s center, or brush too closely against other branches.
Never cut a branch flush to its trunk. Prune above the branch bark ridge and branch collar. Cutting a tree limb flush to the trunk compromises the tree’s ability to heal and fight off disease.
Use the right pruning tools for the job. Use a hand pruner for branches under 1/2&quot;.  Use loppers to cut branches up to 1”.  A pruning hand saw be used for branches over 1/2”. But never use a carpenter’s saw.</j.0:plantMaintenance>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Valerian (Valeriana officinalis, Caprifoliaceae) is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and Asia. In the summer when the mature plant may have a height of 1.5 metres (5 feet), it bears sweetly scented pink or white flowers that attract many fly species, especially hoverflies of the genus Eristalis. It is consumed as food by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species, including the grey pug. Crude extract of valerian root may have sedative and anxiolytic effects, and is commonly sold in dietary supplement capsules to promote sleep, but there is insufficient clinical evidence that it is effective for this purpose. Its roots and leaves cause a catnip-like response in cats.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Viola is a genus of flowering plants in the violet family Violaceae. It is the largest genus in the family, containing between 525 and 600 species. Most species are found in the temperate Northern Hemisphere; however, some are also found in widely divergent areas such as Hawaii, Australasia, and the Andes. Some Viola species are perennial plants, some are annual plants, and a few are small shrubs. Many species, varieties and cultivars are grown in gardens for their ornamental flowers. In horticulture the term pansy is normally used for those multi-colored, large-flowered cultivars which are raised annually or biennially from seed and used extensively in bedding. The terms viola and violet are normally reserved for small-flowered annuals or perennials, including the wild species.</j.0:plantDescription>

        <j.0:plantDescription>Emerald Zoysia (Zoysia &apos;Emerald&apos;) is a cultivar of Zoysia grass with a thin bladed leaf that forms a very lush lawn. It shares the drought and shade resistance of the other varieties. This grass has a fine, soft texture and can be left unmown as it only grows to a height of 6–12 inches (15–30 cm). When left unmown, it forms a humpy convoluted surface which is sometimes used in oriental landscapes (see picture on Zoysia page).</j.0:plantDescription>
        <j.0:plantDiseases>Volutella leaf and stem blight is the most common disease on pachysandra. The disease is usually promoted by excessive moisture for long periods of time. The fungus causes black blotches on the leaves and black cankers on the stem. To control Volutella leaf blight, avoid excess moisture from overhead irrigation. A fungicide spray program started in the spring can usually prevent the disease from spreading.
Several fungal leaf spots and a severe Xanthomonas bacterial leaf spot are possible causes for brown or black spots on English ivy.</j.0:plantDiseases>

        <j.0:plantMaintenance>In the year after planting, check the soil regularly and water it deeply when it begins to dry out. Watering frequency will depend on the site, soil composition, temperature, exposure to wind and amount of rainfall.For plants that require rich soil, work in a 2.5 cm layer of compost around the base of the plants every year.Remove weeds as they appear to prevent them from spreading. Some ground covers become less vigorous after a number of years. To revitalize them, divide clumps in spring or fall.</j.0:plantMaintenance>
